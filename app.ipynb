Person capable of making wills. —Every person of sound mind not being a minor may dispose \\nof his property by will.  \\nExplanation  1.—A married woman may dispose by will of any property which she could alienate by \\nher own act d uring her life.  \\nExplanation  2.—Persons who are deaf or dumb or blind are not thereby incapacitated for making a \\nwill if they are able to know what they do by it.  \\nExplanation  3.—A person who is ordinarily insane may make a will during interval in which he is of \\nsound mind.  \\nExplanation  4.—No person can make a will while he is in such a state of mind, whether arising from \\nintoxication or from illness or from any other cause, tha t he does not know what he is doing.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A can perceive what is going on in his immediate neighbourhood, and can answer familiar questions, but has \\nnot a competent understanding as to the nature of his property, or the persons who are of kind red to him, or in whose \\nfavour it would be proper that he should make his will. A cannot make a valid will.  \\n(ii) A executes an instrument purporting to be his will, but he does not understand the nature of the instrument, \\nnor the effect of its provisions. This instrument is not a valid will.  \\n(iii) A, being very feeble and debilitated, but capable of exercising a judgment as to the proper mode of \\ndisposing of his property, makes a will. This is a valid will.  \\n60. Testamentary guardian. —A father, whatever his age may be, may by will appoint a guardian or \\nguardians for his child during minority.  \\n61. Will obtained by fraud, coercion orimportunity. —A will or any part of a will, the making of \\nwhich has been caused by fraud or coercion, or by such importunity as tak es away the free agency of the \\ntestator, is void.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A, falsely and knowingly represents to the testator, that the testator ’s only child is dead, or that he has done \\nsome undutiful act and thereby induces the. testator to make a will in his,  A’s favour; such will has been obtained by \\nfraud, and is  \\n(ii) A, by fraud and deception, prevails upon the testator to bequeath a legacy to him. The bequest is void.  \\n(iii) A, being a prisoner by lawful authority, makes his will. The will is not invalid by  reason of the \\nimprisonment.  \\n                                                      \\n1. Sub -section ( 2) omitted by Act 18 of 1929, s. 3 (w.e.f .1 -10-1929) which was earlier inserted by Act 37 of 1926, s. 2 (w.e.f. 9 -\\n9-1926).  \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Schedule  for “the States”.  27 (iv) A threatens to shoot B, or to burn his house or to cause him to be arrested on a criminal charge, unless he \\nmakes a bequest in favour of C. B, in consequence, makes a bequest in favour of C. The bequest is void, the making  \\nof it having been caused by coercion.  \\n(v) A, being of sufficient intellect, if undistrubed by the influence of others, to make a will yet being so much \\nunder the control of B that he is not a free agent, makes a will, dictated by B. It appears that he wou ld not have \\nexecuted the will but for fear of B. The will is invalid.  \\n(vi) A, being in so feeble a state of health as to be unable to resist importunity, is pressed by B to make a will of \\na certain purport and does so merely to purchase peace and in submis sion to B. The will is invalid.  \\n(vii) A being in such a state of health as to be capable of exercising his own judgment and volition, B uses \\nurgent intercession and persuasion with him to induce him to make a will of a certain purport. A, in consequence of  \\nthe intercession and persuasion, but in the free exercise of his judgment and volition makes his will in the manner\",\n",
       " \"of it having been caused by coercion.  \\n(v) A, being of sufficient intellect, if undistrubed by the influence of others, to make a will yet being so much \\nunder the control of B that he is not a free agent, makes a will, dictated by B. It appears that he wou ld not have \\nexecuted the will but for fear of B. The will is invalid.  \\n(vi) A, being in so feeble a state of health as to be unable to resist importunity, is pressed by B to make a will of \\na certain purport and does so merely to purchase peace and in submis sion to B. The will is invalid.  \\n(vii) A being in such a state of health as to be capable of exercising his own judgment and volition, B uses \\nurgent intercession and persuasion with him to induce him to make a will of a certain purport. A, in consequence of  \\nthe intercession and persuasion, but in the free exercise of his judgment and volition makes his will in the manner \\nrecommended by B. The will is not redered invalid by the intercession and persuasion of B.  \\n(viii) A, with a view to obaining a legacy from B, pays him attention and flatters him and thereby produces in \\nhim a capricious partiality to A. B, in consequence of such attention and flattery, makes his will, by which he leaves \\na legacy to A. The bequest is not rendered invalid by the attention and fl attery of A.  \\n62. Will may be revoked or altered. —A will is liable to be revoked or altered by the maker of it at \\nany time when he is competent to dispose of his property by will.  \\nCHAPTER  III.—Of the Execution of unprivileged Wills  \\n63. Execution of unprivileged wills. —Every testator, not being a soldier employed in an expedition \\nor engaged in actual warfare, 1[or an airman so employed or engaged,] or a mariner at sea, shall execute \\nhis will according to the following rules: — \\n(a) The testator shall si gn or shall affix his mark to the will, or it shall be signed by some other \\nperson in his presence and by his direction.  \\n(b) The signature or mark of the testator, or the signature of the person signing for him, \\nshall be so placed that it shall appear that  it was intended thereby to give effect to the writing \\nas a will.  \\n(c) The will shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each of whom has seen the testator \\nsign or affix his mark to the will or has seen some other person sign the will, in the presence an d \\nby the direction of the testator, or has received from the testator a personal acknowledgment of \\nhis signature or mark, or of the signature of such other person; and each of the witnesses shall \\nsign the will in the presence of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that more than one \\nwitness be present at the same time, and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary.  \\n64. Incorporation of papers by reference. —If a testator, in a will or codicil duly attested, refers to \\nany other document the n actually written as expressing any part of his intentions, such document shall be \\ndeemed to form a part of the will or codicil in which it is referred to.  \\nCHAPTER  IV.—Of privileged Wills  \\n65. Privileged wills. —Any soldier being employed in an expedition or engaged in actual warfare, \\n1[or an airman so employed or engaged,] or any mariner being at sea, may, if he has completed the age of \\neighteen years, dispose of his property by a will made in the manner provided  in section 66. Such wills \\nare called privileged wills.  \\n                                                      \\n1. Ins. by Act 10 of 1927, s. 2 and the First Schedule (w.e.f. 4 -4-1927).  28 Illustrations  \\n(i) A, a medical officer attached to a regiment is actually employed in an expedition. He is a soldier actually \\nemployed in an expedition, and can make a privileged will.  \\n(ii) A is at se a in a merchant -ship, of which he is the purser. He is a mariner, and, being at sea, can make a \\nprivileged will.  \\n(iii) A, a soldier serving in the field against insurgents, is a soldier engaged in actual warfare, and as such can \\nmake a privileged will.  \\n(iv) A, a mariner of a ship, in the course of a voyage, is temporarily on shore while she is lying in harbour. He \\nis, for the purposes of this section, a mariner at sea, and can make a privileged will.  \\n(v) A, an admiral who commands a naval force, but who liv es on shore, and only occasionally goes on board his \\nship, is not considered as at sea, and cannot make a privleged will.  \\n(vi) A, a mariner serving on a military expedition, but not being at sea, is considered as a soldier, and can make \\na privileged will.  \\n66. Mode of making, and rules fo r executing, privileged wills. —(1) Privileged wills may be in \\nwriting, or may be made by word of mouth.  \\n(2) The execution of privileged wills shall be governed by the following rules: —  \\n(a) The will may be written wholly by the testator, with his own hand. In such case it need not be \\nsigned or attested.  \\n(b) It may be written wholly or in part by another person, and signed by the testator. In such case \\nit need not be attested.  \\n(c) If the instrument purporting to be a will is w ritten wholly or in part by another person and is \\nnot signed by the testator, it shall be deemed to be his will, if it is shown that it was written by the \\ntestator's directions or that he recognised it as his will.  \\n(d) If it appears on the face of the inst rument that the execution of it in the manner intended by \\nthe testator was not completed, the instrument shall not, by reason of that circumstance, be invalid, \\nprovided that his non -execution of it can be reasonably ascribed to some cause other than the \\nabandonment of the testamentary intentions expressed in the instrument.  \\n(e) If the soldier, 1[airman] or mariner has written instructions for the preparation of his will, but \\nhas died before it could be prepared and executed, such instructions shall be considered to constitute \\nhis will.  \\n(f) If the soldier, 1[airman] or mariner has, in the presence of two witnesses, given verbal \\ninstructions for the preparation of his will, and they have been reduced into writing in his lifetime, but \\nhe has died before the instrument could be prepared and executed, such instructions shall be \\nconsidered to constitute his will, although they may not have been reduced int o writ ing in his \\npresence, nor read over to him.  \\n(g) The soldier, 1[airman] or mariner may make a will b y word of mouth by declaring his \\nintentions before two witnesses present at the same time.  \\n(h) A will made by word of mouth shall be null at the expiration of one month after the testator, \\nbeing still alive, has ceased to be entitled to make a privileged w ill. \\nCHAPTER  V.—Of the Attestation, Revocation, Alteration and Revival of Wills  \\n67. Effect of gift to attesting witness. —A will shall not be deemed to be insufficiently attested by \\nreason of any benefit thereby given either by way of bequest or by way of a ppointment to any person \\nattesting it, or to his or her wife or husband; but the bequest or appointment shall be void so far \\nasconcerns the person so attesting, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claiming under \\neither of them.  \\n                                                      \\n1. Ins. by Act 10 of 1927, s. 2 and the First Schedule (w.e.f. 4 -4-1927).  29 Explanation .—A legatee under a will does not lose his legacy by attesting a codicil which confirms \\nthe will.  \\n68. Witness not disqualified by interest or by being executor. —No person, by reason of interest in, \\nor of his being an executor of, a will, shall be disqualif ied as a witness to prove the execution of the will \\nor to prove the validity or invalidity thereof.  \\n69. Revocation of will by testator ’s marriage. —Every will shall be revoked by the marriage of the \\nmaker, except a will made in exercise of a power of appoin tment, when the property over which the \\npower of appointment is exercised would not, in default of such appointment, pass to his or her executor \\nor administrator, or to the person entitled in case of intestacy.  \\nExplanation .—Where a man is invested with pow er to determine the disposition of property of which \\nhe is not the owner, he is said to have power to appoint such property.  \\n70. Revocation of  unprivileged will or codicil. —No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part \\nthereof, shall be trevoked  otherwise than by marriage, or by another will or codicil, or by some writing \\ndeclaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the manner in which an unprivileged will is \\nherein before required to be executed, or by the burning, tearing, or other wise destroying the same by the \\ntestator or by some person in his presence and by his direction with the intention of revoking the same.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A has made an unprivileged will. Afterwards, A makes another unprivileged will which purports to revo ke \\nthe first. This is a revocation.  \\n(ii) A has made an unprivileged will. Afterwards, A, being entitled to make a privileged will, makes a privileged \\nwill, which purports to revoke his unprivil eged will. This is a revocation.  \\n71. Effect of obliteration, in terlineation or alteration in unprivileged will. —No obliteration, \\ninterlineation or other alteration made in any unprivileged will after the execution thereof shall have any \\neffect, except so far as the words or meaning of the will have been thereby render ed illegible or \\nundiscernible, unless such alteration has been executed in like manner as hereinbefore is required for the \\nexecution of the will:  \\nProvided that the will, as so altered, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the \\ntestator an d the subscription of the witnesses is made in the margin or on some other part of the will \\nopposite or near to such alteration, or at the foot or end of or opposite to a memorandum referring to such \\nalteration, and written at the end or some other part of  the will.  \\n72. Revocation of privileged will or codicil. —A privileged will or codicil, may be revoked by the\",\n",
       " \"71. Effect of obliteration, in terlineation or alteration in unprivileged will. —No obliteration, \\ninterlineation or other alteration made in any unprivileged will after the execution thereof shall have any \\neffect, except so far as the words or meaning of the will have been thereby render ed illegible or \\nundiscernible, unless such alteration has been executed in like manner as hereinbefore is required for the \\nexecution of the will:  \\nProvided that the will, as so altered, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the \\ntestator an d the subscription of the witnesses is made in the margin or on some other part of the will \\nopposite or near to such alteration, or at the foot or end of or opposite to a memorandum referring to such \\nalteration, and written at the end or some other part of  the will.  \\n72. Revocation of privileged will or codicil. —A privileged will or codicil, may be revoked by the \\ntestator by an unprivileged will .or codicil, or by any act expressing an intention to revoke it and \\naccompanied by such formalities as would be su fficient to give validity to a privileged will, or by the \\nburning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator, or by some person in his presence and \\nby his direction, with the intention of revoking the same.  \\nExplanation .—In order to the revoc ation of a privileged will or codicil by an act accompanied by \\nsuch formalities as would be sufficient to give validity to a privileged will, it is not necessary that the \\ntestator should at the time of doing that act be in a situation which entitles him to  make a privileged will  \\n73. Revival of unprivileged will. —(1) No unprivileged will or codicil, nor any part thereof, which \\nhas been revoked in any manner, shall be revived otherwise than by the re -execution thereof, or by a \\ncodicil executed in manner herei nbefore required, and showing an intention to revive the same.  \\n(2) When any will or codicil, which has been partly revoked and afterwards wholly revoked, is \\nrevived, such revival shall not extend to so much thereof as has been revoked before the revocation  of the \\nwhole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary is shown by the will or codicil.  30 CHAPTER  VI.—Of the construction of Wills  \\n74. Wording of wills. —It is not necessary,.that  any technical words or terms of art be used in a will, \\nbut only that the wording be such that the intentions of the testator can be known therefrom.  \\n75. Inquiries to determine questions as to object or subject of will. —For the purpose of \\ndetermining quest ions as to what person or what property is denoted by any words used in a will, a Court \\nshall inquire into every material fact relating to the persons who claim to be interested under such will, \\nthe property which is claimed as the subject of disposition, the circumstances of the testator and of his \\nfamily, and into every fact a knowledge of which may conduce to the right application of the words which \\nthe testator has used.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A, by his will, bequeaths 1,000 rupees to his eldest son or to hi s youngest grandchild, or to his cousin, Mary. \\nA Court may make inquiry in order to ascertain to what person the description in the will applies.  \\n(ii) A, by his will, leaves to B “my estate called Black Acre ”. It may be necessary to take evidence in order to \\nascertain what is the subject -matter of the bequest; that is to say, what estate of thetestator ’s is called Black Acre.  \\n(iii) A, by his will, leaves to B “the estate which I purchased of C ”. It may be necessary to take evidence in \\norder to ascertain wha t estate the testator purchased of C.  \\n76. Misnomer or misdescription of object. —(1) Where the words used in a will to designate or \\ndescribe a legatee or a class of legatees sufficiently show what is meant, and error in the name or \\ndescription shall not pre vent the legacy from taking effect.  \\n(2) A mistake in the name of a legatee may be corrected by a description of him, and a mistake in the \\ndescription of a legatee may be corrected by the name.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequeaths a legacy to “Thomas, the second s on of my brother John ”. The testator has an only brother \\nnamed John, who has no son named Thomas, but has a second son whose name is William. William will have the \\nlegacy.  \\n(ii) A bequeaths a legacy “to Thomas, the second son of my brother John ”. The testator has an only brother, \\nnamed John, whose first son is named Thomas and whose second son is named William. Thomas will have the \\nlegacy.  \\n(iii) The testator bequeaths his property “to A and B, the legitimate children of C ”. C has no legitimate child, \\nbut has two illegitimate children, A and B. The bequest to A and B takes effect, although they are illegitimate.  \\n(iv) The testator gives his residuary estate to be divided among “my seven children ” and, proceeding to \\nenumerate them, mentions six names only.  This omission will not prevent the seventh child from taking a share with \\nthe others.  \\n(v) The testator, having six grandchildren, makes a bequest to “my six grandchildren ” and, proceeding to \\nmention them by their Christian names, mentions one twice over o mitting another altogether. The one whose name \\nis not mentioned will take a share with the others.  \\n(vi) The testator bequeaths “1,000 rupees to each of the three children of A ”. At the date of the will A has four \\nchildren. Each of these four children will,  if he survives the testator, receive a legacy of 1,000 rupees.  \\n77. When words may be supplied. —Where any word material to the full expression of the meaning \\nhas been omitted, it may be supplied by the context.  31 Illustration  \\nThe testator gives a legacy of “five hundred ” to his daughter A and a legacy of “five hundred rupees ” to his \\ndaughter B. A will take a legacy of five hundred rupees.  \\n78. Rejection of erroneous particulars in description of subject. —If the thing which the testator \\nintended to bequeath can  be sufficiently identified from the description of it given in the will, but some \\nparts of the description do not apply, such parts of the description shall be rejected as erroneous, and the \\nbequest shall take effect.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupation of X ”. The testator had marsh -lands \\nlying in L but had no marsh -lands in the occupation of X. The words “in the occupation of X ” shall be rejected as \\nerroneous, and the marsh lands of the testator lying in L w ill pass by the bequest.  \\n(ii) The testator bequeaths to A “my zamindari of Rampur ”. He had an estate at Rampur but it was a taluq and \\nnot a zamindari. The taluq passes by this bequest.  \\n79. When part of description may not be rejected as erroneous. —If a wil l mentions several \\ncircumstances as descriptive of the thing which the testator intends to bequeath, and there is any property \\nof his in respect of which all those circumstances exist, the bequest shall be considered as limited to such \\nproperty, and it sha ll not be lawful to reject any part of the description as erroneous, because the testator \\nhad other property to which such part of the description does not apply.  \\nExplanation .—In judging whether a case falls within the meaning of this section, any words wh ich \\nwould be liable to rejection under section 78 shall be deemed to have been struck out of the will.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupation of X ”. The testator had marsh -lands \\nlying in L, some of which were in  the occupation of X, and some not in the occupation of X. The bequest will be \\nconsidered as limited to such of the testator's marsh -lands in L as were in the occupation of X.  \\n(ii) A bequeaths to B “my marsh -lands lying in L and in the occupation of X, com prising 1,000 bighas of \\nlands ”. The testator had marshlands lying in L some of which were in the occupation of X and some not in the \\noccupation of X. The measurement is wholly inapplicable to the marsh -lands of either class, or to the whole taken \\ntogether.  The measurement will be considered as struck out of the will, and such of the testator's marsh -lands lying \\nin L as were in the occupation of X shall alone pass by the bequest.  \\n80. Extrinsic evidence admissible in cases of patent ambiguity. —Where the words  of a will are \\nunambiguous, but it is found by extrinsic evidence that they admit of applications, one only of which can \\nhave been intended by the testator, extrinsic evidence may be taken to show which of these applications \\nwas intended.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A man, having two cousins of the name of Mar y, bequeaths a sum of money to “ my cousin Mary ”. It appears \\nthat there are two persons, each answering the description in the will. That description, therefore, admits of two \\napplications, only one of which can have been intended by the testator. Evidence is admissible to show which of the \\ntwo applications was intended.  \\n(ii) A, by his will, leaves to B “my estate called SultanpurKhurd ”. It turns out that he had two estates called \\nSultanpur Khurd. Evidence is admis sible to show which estate was intended.  \\n81. Extrinsic evidence inadmissible in case of patent ambiguity or deficiency. —Where there is an \\nambiguity or deficiency on the face of a will, no extrinsic evidence as to the intentions of the testator shall \\nbe adm itted.  32 Illustrations  \\n(i) A man has an aunt, Caroline, and a cousin, Mary, and has no aunt of the name of Mary. By his Will he \\nbequeaths 1,000 rupees to “my aunt, Caroline” and 1,000 rupees to “my cousin, Mary” and afterwards bequeaths \\n2,000 rupees to “my b efore -mentioned aunt, Mary”. There is no person to whom the description given in the Will \\ncan apply, and evidence is not admissible to show who was meant by “my before -mentioned aunt, Mary”. The \\nbequest is, therefore, void for uncertainty under section 89.\",\n",
       " \"two applications was intended.  \\n(ii) A, by his will, leaves to B “my estate called SultanpurKhurd ”. It turns out that he had two estates called \\nSultanpur Khurd. Evidence is admis sible to show which estate was intended.  \\n81.

By his Will he \\nbequeaths 1,000 rupees to “my aunt, Caroline” and 1,000 rupees to “my cousin, Mary” and afterwards bequeaths \\n2,000 rupees to “my b efore -mentioned aunt, Mary”. There is no person to whom the description given in the Will \\ncan apply, and evidence is not admissible to show who was meant by “my before -mentioned aunt, Mary”. The \\nbequest is, therefore, void for uncertainty under section 89.  \\n(ii) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to............leaving a blank for the name of the legatee. Evidence is not admissible \\nto show what name the testator intended to insert.  \\n(iii) A bequeaths to B .......................rupees, or “my estate of.................. ......” Evidence is not admissible to show \\nwhat sum or what estate the testator intended to insert.  \\n82. Meaning or clause to be collected from entire Will. —The meaning of any clause in a Will is to \\nbe collected from the entire instrument, and all its parts  are to be construed with reference to each other.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) The testator gives to B a specific fund or property at the death of A, and by a subsequent clause gives the \\nwhole of his property to A. The effect of the several clauses taken together is  to vest the specific fund or property in \\nA for life, and after his decease in B; it appearing from the bequest to B that the testator meant to use in a restricted \\nsense the words in which he describes what he gives to A.  \\n(ii) Where a testator having an estate, one part of which is called Black Acre, bequeaths the whole of his estate \\nto A, and in another part of his Will bequeaths Black Acre to B, the latter bequest is to be read as an exception out of \\nthe first as if he had said “I give Black Acre to B, and all the rest of my estate to A”.  \\n83. When words may be understood in restricted sense, and when in sense wider than usual. —\\nGeneral words may be understood in a restricted sense where it may be collected from the Will that the \\ntestator  meant to use them  in a restricted sense; and words may be understood in a wider sense than that \\nwhich they usually bear, where it may be collected from the other words of the Will that the testator \\nmeant to use them in such wider sense.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A testator gives t o A “my farm in the occupation of B ”, and to C “all my marsh -lands in L ”. Part of the farm \\nin the occupation of B consists of marsh -lands in L, and the testator also has other marsh -lands in L, The general \\nwords, “all my marsh -lands in L ”, are restricted b y the gift to A. A takes the whole of the farm in the occupation of \\nB, including that portion of the farm which consists of marshlands in L.  \\n(ii) The testator (a sailor on ship -board) bequeathed to his mother his gold ring, buttons and chest of clothes, \\nand to his friend, A (a shipmate) his red box, clasp -knife and all things not before bequeathed. The testator's share in \\na house does not pass to A under this bequest.  \\n(iii) A, by his Will, bequeathed to B all his household furniture plate, linen, china, boo ks, pictures and all other \\ngoods of whatever kind; and afterwards bequeathed to B a specified part of his property. Under the first bequest is B \\nentitled only to such articles of the testator ’s as are of the same nature with the articles therein enumerated . \\n84. Which of two possible constructions preferred. —Where a clause is susceptible of \\ntwo meanings according to one of which it has some effect, and according to the other of which it can \\nhave none, the former shall be preferred.  \\n85. No part rejected, if it can be reasonably construed. —No part of a Will  shall be rejected as \\ndestitute of meaning if it is possible to put a reasonable construction upon it.  33 86. Interpretation of words repeated in different parts of will. —If the same words occur in \\ndifferent pa rts of the same will, they shall be taken to have been used everywhere in the same sense, \\nunless a contrary intention appears.  \\n87. Testator’s intention to be effectuated as far as possible. —The intention of the testator \\nshall not be set aside because it ca nnot take effect to the full extent, but effect is to be given to it as \\nfar as possible.  \\nIllustration  \\nThe testator by a will made on his death -bed bequeathed all his property to C.D. for life and after his decease to \\na certain hospital. The intention of th e testator cannot take effect to its full extent because the gift to the hospital is \\nvoid under section 118, but it will take effect so far as regards the gift to C.D.  \\n88. The last of two inconsistent clauses preva ils.—Where two clauses of gifts in a will are \\nirreconcileable, so that they cannot possibly stand together, the last shall prevail.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) The testator by the first clause of his will leaves his estate of Ramnagar “to A, ” and by the last clause of his \\nwill leaves it “to B and not to A ”. B will have it.  \\n(ii) If a man, at the commencement of his will gives his house to A, and at the close of it directs that his house \\nshall be sold and the proceeds invested for the benefit of B, the latter disposition will prevail.  \\n89. Will or bequest void for uncertainty. —A will or bequest not expressive of any definite \\nintention is void for uncertainty.  \\nIllustration  \\nIf a testator says “I bequeath goods to A, ” or “I bequeath to A, ” or “I leave to A all the goods mentioned in the \\nSchedule ” and no Schedule is  found, or “I bequeath ‘money, ’‘wheat, ’ ‘oil,’ ” or the like, without saying how much, \\nthis is void.  \\n90. Words describing subject refer to property answering description at testator ’s death. — The \\ndescription contained in a will of property, the subject of gift, shall, unless a contrary intention appears by \\nthe will, be deemed to refer to and comprise the property answering that description at the death of the \\ntestator.  \\n91. Power of appointment executed by general bequest. —Unless a contrary intention appears  by \\nthe will, a bequest of the estate of the testator shall be construed to include any property which he may \\nhave -power to appoint by will to any object he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of \\nsuch power; and a bequest of property descr ibed in a general manner shall be construed to include any \\nproperty to which such description may extend, which he may have power to appoint by will to any object \\nhe may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of such power.  \\n92. Implied gift to obj ects of power in default of appointment. —Where property is bequeathed to \\nor for the benefit of certain objects as a specified person may appoint or for the benefit of certain objects \\nin such proportions as a specified person may appoint, and the will does not provide for the event of no \\nappointment being made; if the power given by the will is not exercised, the property belongs to all the \\nobjects of the power in equal shares.  \\nIllustration  \\nA, by his will bequeaths a fund to his wife, for her life, and direc ts that at her death it shall be divided among \\nhis children in such proportions as she shall appoint. The widow dies without having made any appointment. The \\nfund will be divided equally among the children.  \\n93. Bequest to “heirs, ” etc., of particular person without qualifying terms. —Where a bequest is \\nmade to the “heirs ” or “right heirs ” or “relations ” or “nearest relations ” or “family ” or “kindred ” or \\n“nearest of kin ” or “next-of-kin” of a particular person without any qualifying terms, and the class so \\ndesignated forms the direct and independent object of the bequest, the property bequeathed shall \\nbe  distributed as if it had belonged to such person and he had died intestate in respect of it, leaving assets \\nfor the payment of his debts independently of such property . 34 Illustrations  \\n(i) A leaves his property “to my own nearest relations”. The property goes to those who would be entitled to it if \\nA had died intestate, leaving assets for the payment of his debts independently of such p roperty.  \\n(ii) A bequeaths 10,000 rupees “to B for his life, and, after the death of B, to my own right heirs”. The legacy \\nafter B’s death belongs to those who would be entitled to it if it had formed part of A’s unbequeathed property.  \\n(iii) A leaves his pr operty to B; but if B dies before him, to B’s next -of kin; B dies before A; the property \\ndevolves as if it had belonged to B, and he had died intestate, leaving assets for the payment of his debts \\nindependently of such property.  \\n(iv) A leaves 10,000 rupees  “to B for his life, and after his decease to the heirs of C”. The legacy goes as if it \\nhad belonged to C, and he had died intestate, leaving assets for the payment of his debt independently of the legacy.  \\n94. Bequest to “representatives ”, etc., of particular person. —Where a bequest is made to the \\n“representatives ” or “legal representatives ” or “personal representatives ” or “executors or administrators ” \\nof a particular person, and the class so designated forms the direct and independent object of the  bequest, \\nthe property bequeathed  shall be distributed as if it had belonged to such person and he had died intestate \\nin respect of it.  \\nIllustration  \\nA bequest is made to the “legal representatives ” of A. A has died intestate and insolvent. B is his adminis trator. \\nB is entitled to receive the legacy, and Will apply it in the first place to the discharge of such part of A ’s debt as may\",\n",

The legacy goes as if it \\nhad belonged to C, and he had died intestate, leaving assets for the payment of his debt independently of the legacy.  \\n94. Bequest to “representatives ”, etc., of particular person. —Where a bequest is made to the \\n“representatives ” or “legal representatives ” or “personal representatives ” or “executors or administrators ” \\nof a particular person, and the class so designated forms the direct and independent object of the  bequest, \\nthe property bequeathed  shall be distributed as if it had belonged to such person and he had died intestate \\nin respect of it.  \\nIllustration  \\nA bequest is made to the “legal representatives ” of A. A has died intestate and insolvent. B is his adminis trator. \\nB is entitled to receive the legacy, and Will apply it in the first place to the discharge of such part of A ’s debt as may \\nremain unpaid: if there be any surplus B Will pay it to those persons who at A ’s death would have been entitled to \\nreceive an y property of A ’s which might remain after payment of his debts, or to the representatives of such persons.  \\n95. Bequest without words of limitation. —Where property is bequeathed to any person, he is \\nentitled to the whole interest of the testator therein, u nless it appears from the Will that only a restricted \\ninterest was intended for  him. \\n 96. Bequest in alternative. —Where a property is bequeathed to a person with a bequest in the \\nalternative to  another person or to a class of persons, then, if a contrary i ntention does not appear by the \\nWill, the legatee first named shall be entitled to the legacy if he is alive at the time when it takes effect; \\nbut if he is then dead, the person or class of persons named in the second branch of the alternative shall \\ntake t he legacy.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequest is made to A or to B. A survives the testator. B takes nothing.  \\n(ii) A bequest is made to A or to B. A dies after the date of the Will, and before the testator. The legacy goes to \\nB. \\n(iii) A bequest is made to A or to  B. A is dead at the date of the Will. The legacy goes to B.  \\n(iv) Property is bequeathed to A or his heirs. A survives the testator.

A \\nsurvives the testator. Upon A\\'s death the bequest to the heirs of B takes effect.  35 97. Effect of words describing a class added to bequest to person. —Where property is bequeathed \\nto a person, and words are added which describe a class of persons but do not denote them as direct \\nobjects of a distinct and independent gift, such person is entitled to the  whole interest of the testator \\ntherein, unless a contrary intention appears by the will.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequest is made —  \\nto A and his children,  \\nto A and his children by his present wife,  \\nto A and his heirs,  \\nto A and the heirs of his body,  \\nto A and t he heirs male of his body,  \\nto A and the heirs female of his body,  \\nto A and his issue,  \\nto A and his family,  \\nto A and his descendants,  \\nto A and his representatives,  \\nto A and his personal representatives,  \\nto A, his executors and administrators.  \\nIn each of these cases, A takes the whole interest which the testator had in the property.  \\n(ii) A bequest is made to A and his brothers. A and his brothers are jointly entitled to the legacy.  \\n(iii) A bequest is made to A for life and after his death to his issue. At the death of A the property belongs in \\nequal shares to all persons who then answer the description of issue of A.  \\n98. Bequest to class of persons under general description only. —Where a bequest is made to a \\nclass of persons under a general description only , no one to whom the words of the description are not in \\ntheir ordinary sense applicable shall take the legacy.  \\n99. Construction of terms. —In a will —  \\n(a) the word “children ” applies only to lineal descendants in the first degree of the person whose \\n“children ” are spoken of;  \\n(b) the word “grandchildren ” applies only to lineal descendants in the second degree of the person \\nwhose “grand children ” are spoken of;  \\n(c) the words “nephews ” and “nieces ” apply only to children of brothers or sisters;  \\n(d) the wo rds “cousins, ” or “first cousins, ” or “cousins -german, ” apply only to children of \\nbrothers or of sisters of the father or mother of the person whose “cousins, ” or “first cousins, ” or \\n“cousins -german, ” are spoken of;  \\n(e) the words “first cousins once remove d” apply only to children of cousins -german, or to \\ncousins -german of a parent of the person whose “first cousins once removed ” are spoken of;  \\n(f) the words “second cousins ” apply only to grandchildren of brothers or of sisters of the \\ngrandfather or grandmo ther of the person whose “second cousins ” are spoken of;  \\n(g) the words “issue ” and “descendants ” apply to all lineal descendants whatever of the person \\nwhose “issue ” or “descendants ” are spoken of;  \\n(h) words expressive of collateral relationship apply alike to relatives of full and of half blood; \\nand \\n(i) all words expressive of relationship apply to a child in the womb who is afterwards born alive.  36 100. Words expressing relationship denote only legitimat e relatives or failing such relatives \\nreputed legitimate. —In the absence of any intimation to the contrary in a will, the word “child, ” the \\nword  “son”, the word “daughter” or any word which expresses relationship, is to be understood as \\ndenoting only a leg itimate relative, or, where there is no such legitimate relative, a person who has \\nacquired, at the date of the Will, the reputation of being such relative.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A having three children, B, C and A of whom B and Care legitimate and D is illegi timate leaves his property \\nto be equally divided among “my children ”. The property belongs to B and C in equal shares, to the exclusion of D.  \\n(ii) A, having a niece of illegitimate birth, who has acquired the reputation of being his niece and having no \\nlegitimate niece, bequeaths a sum of money to his niece. The illegitimate niece is entitled to the legacy.  \\n(iii) A, having in his Will enumerated his children, and named as one of them B, who is illegitimate, leaves a \\nlegacy to “my said children ”. B Will take  a share in the legacy along with the legitimate children.  \\n(iv) A leaves a legacy to “the children of B ”. B is dead and has left none but illegitimate children. All those who \\nhad at the date of the Will acquired the reputation of being the children of B ar e objects of the gift.  \\n(v) A bequeaths a legacy to “the children of B ”. B never had any legitimate child. C and D had, at the date of \\nthe Will, acquired the reputation of being children of B. After the date of the Will and before the death of the \\ntestator,  E and F were born, and acquired the reputation of being children of B. Only C and D are objects of the \\nbequest.  \\n(vi) A makes a bequest in favour of his child by a certain woman, not his wife. B had acquired at the date of the \\nWill the reputation of being the child of A by the woman designated. B takes the legacy.  \\n(vii) A makes a bequest in favour of his child to be born of a woman who never becomes his wife. The bequest \\nis void.  \\n(viii) A makes a bequest in favour  of the child of which a certain woman, not married to him, is pregnant. The \\nbequest is void.  \\n101. Rules of construction where will purports to make two bequests to same person. —Where a \\nwill purports to make two bequests to the same person, and a question arises whether the testator intended \\nto make the second bequest instead of or in addition to the first; if there is nothing in the will to  show \\nwhat he intended, the following rules shall have effect in determining the construction to be put upon the \\nwill:— \\n(a) If the same specific thing is bequeathed twice to the same legatee in the same will or in the \\nwill and again in the codicil, he is entitled to receive that specific thing only.  \\n(b) Where one and the same will or one and the same codicil purports to m ake, in two places, a \\nbequest to the same person of the same quantity or amount of anything, he shall be entitled to one \\nsuch legacy only.  \\n(c) Where two legacies of unequal amount are given to the same person in the same will, or in the \\nsame codicil, the l egatee is entitled to both.  \\n(d) Where two legacies, whether equal or unequal in amount, are given to the same legatee, one \\nby a will and the other by a codicil, or each by a different codicil, the legatee is entitled to both \\nlegacies.  \\nExplanation : In claus es (a) to ( d) of this section, the word “will”does not include a codicil.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A, having ten shares, and no more, in the Imperial Bank of India, made his Will, which contains near its \\ncommencement the words “I bequeath my ten shares in the Imperial Bank of India to B ”. After other bequests, the \\nWill concludes with the words \"and I bequeath my ten shares in the Imperial Bank of India to B\". B is entitled \\nsimply to receive A’ s ten shares in the Imperial Bank of India.  37 (ii) A, having one diamon d ring, which was given to him by B, bequeaths to C the diamond ring which was \\ngiven by B. A afterwards made a codicil to his Will, and thereby, after giving other legacies, he bequeathed to C the \\ndiamond ring which was given to him by B, C can claim nothi ng except the diamond ring which was given to A by \\nB.',\n",

B is entitled absolutely to one sum of 5,000 rupees, and takes a contingent interest in \\nanother sum of 5,000 rupees.  \\n102. Constitution of residuary legatee. —A residuary legatee may be constituted by any words that \\nshow an intention on the part of the testator that the person designated shall take the surplus or residue of \\nhis property.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A makes her will, consisting of several testamentary papers, in one of which are contained the following \\nwords: —“I think there will be something left, after all funeral expenses, etc., to give to B, now at school, towards \\nequipping him to any profession he may hereafter be appointed to. ” B is constituted residuary legatee.  \\n(ii) A makes his will, with the following passage at the end of it: —“I believe there will be found sufficient in \\nmy banker ’s hands to defray and discharge my debts, which I hereby, desire B to do, and keep the residue for her \\nown use and pleasure. ” B is constituted the residuary legatee.  \\n(iii) A bequeaths all his property to B, except certain stock and funds, which he bequeaths  to C.

Property to which residuary legatee entitled .—Under a residuary bequest, the legatee is \\nentitled to all property belonging to the testator at the time of his death, of which he has not made any \\nother testamentary dis position which is capable of taking effect.  \\nIllustration  \\nA by his will bequeaths certain legacies, of which one is void under section 118, and another lapses by the death \\nof the legatee. He bequeaths the residue of his property to B. After the date of his will A purchases a zamindari, \\nwhich belongs to him at the time of his death. B is entitled to the two legacies and the zamindari as part of the \\nresidue.  \\n104. Time of vesting legacy in general terms. —1f a legacy is given in general terms, without \\nspecifying  the time when it is to be paid, the legatee has a vested interest in it from the day of the death of \\nthe testator, and, if he dies without having received it, it shall pass to his representatives.  38 105. In what case legacy lapses. —(1) If the legatee does n ot survive the testator, the legacy cannot \\ntake effect, but shall lapse and form part of the residue of the testator ’s property, unless it appears by the \\nWill that the testator intended that it should go to some other person.  \\n(2) In order to entitle the representatives of the legatee to receive the legacy, it must be proved that he \\nsurvived the testator.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) The testator bequeaths to B “500 rupees which B owes me ”.B dies before the testator; the legacy lapses.  \\n(ii) A bequest is made to A and  his children. A dies before the testator, or happens to be dead when the will is \\nmade.

There is no evidence to show which died first. \\nThe legacy lapses.  \\n106. Legacy does not lapse if one of two joint legatees die before testator. —If a legacy is given to \\ntwo persons jointly, and one of them dies before the testator, t he other legatee takes the whole.  \\nIllustration  \\nThe legacy is simply to A and B. A dies before the testator. B takes the legacy.  \\n107. Effect of words showing testator’s intention to give distinct shares. —If a legacy is given to \\nlegatees in words which  show that the testator intended to give them distinct shares of it, then, if any \\nlegatee dies before the testator, so much of the legacy as was intended for him shall fall into the residue of \\nthe testator\\'s property.  \\nIllustration  \\nA sum of money is bequeathed to  A, B and C, to be equally divided among them. A dies before the testator, B \\nand C Will only take so much as they would have had if A had survived the testator.  \\n108. When lapsed share goes as undisposed of. —Where a  share which lapses is a part of the \\ngener al residue bequeathed by the Will, that share shall go as undisposed of.  \\nIllustration  \\nThe testator bequeaths me residue of his estate to A, B and C, to be equally divided between them. A dies \\nbefore the testator. His one -third of the residue goes as undisp osed of.  \\n109. When bequest to testator’s child or lineal descendant does not lapse on his death in \\ntestator ’s lifetime. —Where a bequest has been made to any child or  other lineal descendant of the \\ntestator, and the legatee dies in the lifetime of the testa tor, but any lineal descendant of his survives the \\ntestator, the bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect if the death of the legatee had happened \\nimmediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the Will.  \\nIllustrat ion \\nA makes his Will, by which he bequeaths a sum of money to his son, B, for his own absolute use and benefit. B \\ndies before A, leaving a son, C, who survives A, and having made his Will whereby he bequeaths all his property to \\nhis widow. D. The money goes to D.  \\n110. Bequest to A for benefit of B does not lapse by A’s death. —Where a bequest is made to one \\nperson, for the benefit of  another, the legacy does not lapse by the death, in the testator’s lifetime, of the \\nperson to whom the bequest is made.  39 111. Survivorship in case of bequest to described class. —Where a bequest is made simply to a \\ndescribed class of persons, the thing bequeathed shall go only to such as are alive at the testator ’s death.  \\nException .—If property is bequeathed to a class of person s described as standing in a particular \\ndegree of kindred to a specified individual, but their possession of it is deferred until a time later than the \\ndeath of the testator by reason of a prior bequest or otherwise, the property shall at that time go to s uch of \\nthem as are then alive, and to the representatives of any of them who have died since the death of the \\ntestator.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to “the children of B ” without saying when it is to be distributed among them. B \\nhad died pre vious to the date of the will, leaving three children, C, D and E. E died after the date of the will, but \\nbefore the death of A. C and D survive A.

At the death of \\nthe testator, B had two sisters living,  C and D, and after that event another sister E was born. C died during the life \\nof B, D and E have survived B. One -third of A ’s land belong to D, E and the representatives of C, in, equal shares.  \\n(v) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to B for life and after his de ath equally among the children of C.

The bequest after the death of B is void.  \\n(vi) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to “all the children born or to be born ” of B to be divided among them at the \\ndeath of C. At the dea th of the testator, B has two children living, D and E. After the death of the testator, but in the \\nlifetime of C, two other children, F and G, are born to B. After the death of C, another child is horn to B. The legacy \\nbelongs to D, E, F and G, to the exc lusion of the after -born child of B.  \\n(vii) A bequeaths a fund to the children of B, to be divided among them when the eldest shall attain majority. At \\nthe testator's death, B had one child living, named C. He afterwards had two other children, named D and E. E died, \\nbut C and D were living when C attained majority. The fund belongs to C, D and the representatives of E, to the \\nexclusion of any child who may be born to B after C ’s attaining majority.  \\nCHAPTER VII.—Of void Bequests  \\n112. Bequest to person by par ticular description, who is not in existence at testator ’s death. —\\nWhere a bequest is made to a person by a particular description, and there is no person in existence at the \\ntestator's death who answers the description, the bequest is void.  \\nException .—If property is bequeathed to a person described as standing in a particular degree of \\nkindred to a specified individual, but his possession of it is deferred until a time later than the deathofthe \\ntestator, by reason of a prior bequest or otherwise; and if a person answering the description isalive at the \\ndeath of the testator, or comes into existence between that event and such later time, the property shall, at \\nsuch later time, go to that person, or, if he is dead, to his representatives.  40 Illustrations  \\n(i) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to the eldest son of B. At the death of the testator, B has no son. The bequest is \\nvoid.  \\n(ii) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to B for life, and after his death to the eldest son of C. At the death of the testator, \\nC had no son. After wards, during the life of B, a son is born to C. Upon B ’s death the legacy goes to .C's son.  \\n(iii) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to B for life, and after his death to the eldest son of C. At the death of the testator, \\nC had no son. Afterwards, during the life o f B, a son, named D, is born to C. D dies, then B dies. The legacy goes to \\nthe representative of D.  \\n(iv) A bequeaths his estate of Green Acre to be for life, and at his decease, to the eldest son of C. Up to the \\ndeath of B, C has had no son. The bequest to  C’s eldest son is void.  \\n(v) A bequeaths 1,000 rupees to the eldest son of C, to be paid to him after the death of B. At the death of the \\ntestator C has no son, but a son is afterwards born to him during the life of B and is alive at B ’s death. C’ s son is \\nentitled to the 1,000 rupees.  \\n113. Bequest to person not in existence at testator's death subject to prior bequest. —Where a \\nbequest is made to a person not in existence at the time of the testator's death, subject to a prior bequest \\ncontained in the will, the later bequest shall be void, unless it comprises the whole of the remaining \\ninterest of the testator in the thing bequeathed.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) Property is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his eldest son for life, and after the deat h of the \\nlatter to his eldest son. At the time of the testator ’s death, A has no son. Here the bequest to A ’s eldest son is a \\nbequest to a person n ot in existence at the testator’ s death. It is not a bequest of the whole interest that remains to the \\ntestator. The bequest to A ’s eldest son for his life is void.  \\n(ii) A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his daughters. A survives the testator. A has \\ndaughters some of whom were not in existence at the tes tator’s death. The beques t to A’ s daughters comprises the \\nwhole interest that remains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. The bequest to A ’s daughters is valid.  \\n(iii) A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to his daughters, with a direction that, if any o f \\nthem marries under the age of eighteen, her portion shall be settled so that it may belong, to herself for life and may \\nbe divisible among her children after her death. A has no daughters living at the time of the testator ’s death, but has \\ndaughters born  afterwards who survive him. Here the direction for a settlement has the effect in the case of each \\ndaughter who marries under eighteen of substituting for the absolute bequest to her a bequest to her merely for her \\nlife; that is to say, a bequest to a per son not in existence at the time of the testator ’s death of something which is less \\nthan the whole interest that remains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. The direction to settle the fund is void.  \\n(iv) A bequeaths a sum of money to B for life, and d irects that upon the death of B the fund shall be settled upon \\nhis daughters, so that the portion of each daughter  may belong to herself for life, and may be divided among her \\nchildren after her death. B has no daughter living at the time of the testator ’s death. In this case the only bequest to \\nthe daughters of B is contained in the direction to settle the fund, and this direction amounts to a bequest to persons \\nnot yet born, of a life -interest in the fund, that is to say, of something which is less than t he whole interest that \\nremains to the testator in the thing bequeathed. The direction to settle the fund upon the daughters of B is void.  \\n114. Rule against perpetuity. —No bequest is valid whereby the vesting of the thing bequeathed may \\nbe delayed beyond th e life -time of one or more persons living at the testator ’s death and the  minority of \\nsome person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, \\nthe thing bequeathed is to belong.  41 Illustrations  \\n(i) A fund is bequeathed to A for his life and after his death to B for his life; and after B ’s death to such of the \\nsons of B as shall first attain the age of 25. A and B survive the testator. Here the son of B who shall first attain the \\nage of 25 may be a son born after the death of the testator; such son may not attain 25 until more than 18 years have \\nelapsed from the death of the longer liver of A and B; and the vesting of the fund may thus be delayed beyond the \\nlifetime of A and B and the minority of the sons of B. The bequest after B's death is void.  \\n(ii) A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to B for his life, and after B ’s death to such of B's \\nsons as shall first attain the age of 25. B dies in the lifetime of the testator, leaving one or more sons. In this case the \\nsons of B are persons living at the time of the testator ’s decease, and the time ashen either of them will attain 25 \\nnecessarily falls within his own lifetime. The bequest is valid.  \\n(iii) A fund is bequeathed to A for his life, and after his death to B for his life, with a direction that after B ’s \\ndeath it shall be divided amongst such of B ’s children as shall attain the age of 18, but that, if no child of B shall \\nattain that age, the fund shall go to C. Here the time for the div ision of the fund must arrive at the latest at the \\nexpiration of 18 years from the death of B, a person living at the testator's decease. All the bequests are valid.  \\n(iv) A fund is bequeathed to trustees for the benefit of the testator ’s daughters, with a direction that, if any of \\nthem marry under age, her share of the fund shall be settled so as to devolve after her death upon such of her \\nchildren as shall attain the age of 18 . Any daugther of the testator to whom the direction applies must be in existence  \\nat his decease, and any portion of the fund which may eventually be settled as directed must vest not later than 18 \\nyears from the death of the daughters whose share it was. All these provisions are valid.  \\n115. Bequest to a class some of whom may come und er rules in sections 113 and 114. —If a \\nbequest is made to a class of persons with regard to some of whom it is inoperative by reason of the \\nprovisions of section 113 or section 114, such bequest shall be 1[void in regard to those persons only, and \\nnot in r egard to the whole class].  \\nIllustrations  \\n(i) A fund is bequeathed to A for life, and after his death to all his child ren who shall attain the age of 25.

When rescission may be adjudged or refused .—(1) Any person interested in a contract may sue \\nto have it rescinded, and  such rescission may be adjudged by the court in any of the following cases, \\nnamely: — \\n(a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff;  \\n(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the defendant is more to \\nblame than the plaintiff.  \\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub -section ( 1), the court may refuse to rescind the \\ncontract — \\n(a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or  \\n(b) where, owing to the change of circumstances whi ch has taken place since the making of the \\ncontract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), the parties cannot be substantially restored \\nto the position in which they stood when the contract was made; or  \\n(c) where third parties have, during th e subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in good faith \\nwithout notice and for value; or  \\n(d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not severable from \\nthe rest of the contract.  \\nExplanation .—In this section “contract ” in relation to the territories to which the Transfer of Property \\nAct, 1882  (4 of 1882) , does not  extend, means a contract in writing.  \\n28. Rescission in certain circumstances of contracts for the sale or lease of immovable property, \\nthe specific p erformance of which has been decreed .—(1) Where in any suit a decree for specific \\nperformance of a contract for the sale or lease of immovable property  has been made and the purchaser or \\nlessee does not, within the period allowed by the decree or such further period as the  court may allow, pay  \\nthe purchase money or other sum which the court has ordered him to pay, the vendor or lessor may apply \\nin the  same suit in which the decree is made, to have the contract rescinded and on such application the \\ncourt may, by order, rescind the  contract either so far as regards the party in default or altogether, as the \\njustice of the case may require.  \\n(2) Where a contr act is rescinded under sub -section ( 1), the court — \\n(a) shall direct the purchaser or the lessee, if he has obtained possession of the property under the \\ncontract, to restore such pos session to the vendor or lessor, and \\n(b) may direct payment to the vendor or lessor of all the rents and profits which have accrued in \\nrespect of the property from the date on which possession was so obtained by the purchaser or lessee \\nuntil restoration of  possession to the vendor or lessor, and , if the justice of the case so re quires, the \\nrefund of any sum paid by  the vendee or the lessee as earnest money or deposit in connection with the \\ncontract.  \\n(3) If the purchase or lessee pays the purchase  money or other sum which he is ordered to pay under \\nthe decree within the  period referred to in sub -section ( 1), the court may, on application made in the same \\nsuit, award the purchaser or lessee such further  relief as he may be entitled to, including in appropriate cases \\nall or any of the following reliefs, namely: — \\n(a) the execution of a proper conveyance or lease by the vendor or lessor;  13 \\n (b) the delivery of possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property on the execution \\nof such convey ance or lease.  \\n(4) No separate suit in respect of any relief which may be claimed under this section shall lie at the \\ninstance of a vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee, as the case may be.  \\n(5) The costs of any proceedings under this section shall be in the  discretion of the court.  \\n29. Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance .—A plaintiff instituting a suit \\nfor the specific  performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot \\nbe specifically enforced, it may be  rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it refuses to \\nenforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly.  \\n30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity .—On adjudging the rescission of a contract, \\nthe court may require the  party to whom such relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which \\nhe may have received from the other party and to  make any compensation to him which justice may require.  \\nCHAPTER V  \\nCANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS  \\n31. When cancellation may be ordered .—(1) Any person against whom a written instrument is void \\nor voidable, and who  has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him \\nserious injury, ma y sue to have it adjudged  void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so adjudge \\nit and order it to be delivered up and cancelled.  \\n(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908  (16 of 1908) , the court \\nshall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and \\nsuch officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.  \\n32. What instruments may be partially cancel led.—Where an instrument is evidence of different \\nrights or different obligations, the court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the \\nresidue.  \\n33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when instrum ent is \\ncancelled or is successfully resisted as being void or voidable .—(1) On adjudging the cancellation of an \\ninstrument, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be any \\nbenefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation  to him which  \\njustice may require.  \\n(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground — \\n(a) that the instrument sough t to be enforced against him in the suit is voidable, the court may if \\nthe d efendant has received  any benefit under the instrument from the other party, require him to restore, \\nso far as may be, such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it;  \\n(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void by reason of his not \\nhaving been competent to contract under section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872  (9 of 1872) , the \\ncourt may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require \\nhim to restore, so far as may b e, such  benefit to that party, to the extent to which he or his estate has \\nbenefited thereby . \\nCHAPTER VI  \\nDECLARATORY DECREES',\n",

Discretion of court as to declaration of status or right .—Any person entitled to any legal \\ncharacter, or to any right as  to any  property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested \\nto deny, his title to such character or right, and the  court may in its discretion make therein a declaration \\nthat he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need  not in such suit ask for any further relief:  \\nProvided that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further \\nrelief than a mere  declaration of title, omits to do so.  14 \\n Explanation. —A trustee of property is a “person interested to deny ” a title adverse to the title of some \\none who is not inexistence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee.  \\n35. Effect of declaration .—A declaration made under this Chapter is binding only on the parties to the \\nsuit, persons claiming through them respec tively, and, where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons \\nfor whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees.  \\n \\nPART III  \\nPREVENTIVE RELIEF  \\nCHAPTER VII  \\nINJUNCTIONS GENERALLY  \\n36. Preventive relief how granted .—Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by \\ninjunction, temporary or  perpetual.  \\n37.

Perpetual injunction when granted .—(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred \\nto by this Chapter, a  perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an \\nobligation existing in his favour, whether expressly  or by implication.  \\n(2) When any such obli gation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions \\ncontained in  Chapter II.  \\n(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff ’s right to, or enjoyment of,  property, \\nthe court may  grant a perpetual injunctio n in the following cases, namely: — \\n(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff;  \\n(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, \\nby the invasion;  \\n(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief;  \\n(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.  \\n39. Mandatory injunctions .—When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel \\nthe per formance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant \\nan injunction to prevent the breach complained of , and also to compel performance of the requisite acts.  \\n40. Damages in lieu of, or in addition to, injunction .—(1) The plaintiff in a suit for perpetual \\ninjunction under section 38, or  mandatory injunction  under section 39, may claim damages either in \\naddition to, or in substitution for, such injunction and the court may,  if it thinks fit, award such damages.  \\n(2) No relief for damages shall be granted under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such  relief \\nin his plaint:  \\nProvided that where no such damages have been claimed in the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of \\nthe proceedings, allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including such \\nclaim.  \\n(3) The dismissal o f a suit to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the plaintiff shall \\nbar his right to sue for  damages for such breach.  15 \\n 41. Injunction when refused .—An injunction cannot be granted — \\n(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial  proceeding pending at the institution of the \\nsuit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of \\nproceedings;  \\n(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a court not             sub-\\nordinate to that from  which the injunction is sought;  \\n(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body;  \\n(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter;  \\n(e) to prevent the breach of  a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced;  \\n(f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a \\nnuisance;  \\n(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquies ced; \\n(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding \\nexcept in case  of breach of trust;  \\n1[(ha) if it would impede or delay the progress or completion of any infrastructure project  or \\ninterfere with the co ntinued provision of relevant facility related thereto or services  being the s ubject \\nmatter of such project.]  \\n(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to be the \\nassistance of the court;  \\n(j) when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter.  \\n42.

Who are competent to contract .—Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of \\nmajority according to th e law to which he is subject3, and who is of sound mind , and is not disqualified \\nfrom contracting by any l aw to which he is subject.  \\n12. What is a sound mind f or the purposes of contracting .—A person is said to be of sound mind \\nfor the purpose of making a contract , if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it \\nand of forming a rational judgment as to  its effect upon his interests.  \\nA person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a con tract \\nwhen he is of sound mi nd. \\nA person who is usually of soun d mind, but occasionally of un sound mind, may not make a contr act \\nwhen he is of unsound mind.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may c ontract during those intervals.  \\n(b) A sane man, who is delirious from fever or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a contract , or form a \\nrational judgment as to its effect on his interests, cannot contract whilst such  delirium or drunkenness lasts.  \\n13. “ Consent ” defined .—Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon th e same \\nthing in the same sense.  \\n14. “Free consent ” defined .—Consent is said to be  free when it is not caused by — \\n(1) coercio n, as defined in section 15, or  \\n(2) undue influenc e, as defined in section 16, or  \\n(3) frau d, as defined in section 17, or  \\n(4) misrepresentatio n, as defined in section 18, or  \\n(5) mistake, subject to the provis ions of sections 20, 21 and 22.  \\nConsent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for the exist ence of such \\ncoercion, undue influence, fraud , misrepresentation or mistake.  \\n15. “Coercion ” defined .—“Coercion ” is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden \\nby the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860 )or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to \\nthe prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.  \\n                                                           \\n1.

Subs. by Act 3 o f 1951, s. 3 and Sch., for “Part A States and Part C States” which had been subs. by the A.O. 1950, for  \\n“the Provinces”.  \\n2. See e.g. , s. 25, infra ; the C opyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957), s . 19; the Carriers Act, 1865 (3 of 1865) ss. 6 and 7;  \\nthe Companies  Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) , ss. 12, 30, 46 and 109.  \\n3. See the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875).  14 \\n Explanation .—It is immaterial whether the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860) is or is not in force in the \\nplace where the coercion is employed.  \\nIllustration  \\nA, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal \\nintimidat ion under the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860 ). \\nA afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Calcutta.  \\nA has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and although section 506 of the Indian \\nPenal Code  (45 of 1860) was not in force at the time when or place where the act was done.  \\n1[16.“Undue influence ” defined .—(1) A contract is said to be induced by “undue influence ” where \\nthe relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the \\nwill of the other and uses that position to obtain an u nfair advantage over the other.  \\n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the gene rality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed \\nto be in a position t o dominate the will of another — \\n(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other , or where he stands in a fiduciary \\nrelation to the other; or  \\n(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently \\naffected by reason of age, illness, or mental  or bodily distress.  \\n(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with \\nhim, and the t ransaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the \\nburden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a \\nposition to dominate the will of the other.  \\nNothing in this s ub-section shall affe ct the provisions of section 111  of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872  \\n(1 of 1872 ). \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B ’s coming of age obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond \\nfrom B  for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the adva nce. A employs undue influence.  \\n(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B ’s influence over him as his medical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable \\nsum for his professional servi ces. B employs undue influence.  \\n(c) A, being in debt to B, the money -lender of his village, contracts a fresh loan on terms which appear to be unconscionable. It lies on B to \\nprove that the contract was not induced by undue influence.  \\n(d) A applies to a banker for a loan at a time when there is stringency in the money market. The banker declines to make the loan  except at \\nan unusually high rate of interest. A accepts the loan on these terms. This is a transaction in the ordinary course of business, and the contract is \\nnot induced by undue influence.]  \\n17. “Fraud ” defined .—“Fraud ” means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party \\nto a contract, or with his  connivance, or by his agent2, with intent to deceive another party thereto of his \\nagent, or to induce h im to enter into the contract: — \\n(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not bel ieve it to be true ; \\n(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;  \\n(3) a promise made without  any intention of performing it;  \\n(4) any other act fitted to deceive;  \\n(5) any such act or omission as the law specially decl ares to be fraudulent.  \\nExplanation .—Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a \\ncontract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the \\nduty of the p erson keeping silence to speak3, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech.  \\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 2 , for the original s. 16.  \\n2. Cf. s. 238, infra . \\n3. See s. 143, infra . 15 \\n Illustrations  \\n(a)  A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound. A says nothing to B about the horse ’s unsou ndness. \\nThis is not fraud in A.  \\n(b) B is A ’s daughter and has just come of age. Here, the relation between the parties would make it A ’s duty to tell B if the \\nhorse is unsound.  \\n(c) B says to A —“If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound. ” A says nothing. Here, A ’s silence is \\nequivale nt to speech.  \\n(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract. A has private information of a change in prices which would affect B ’s \\nwillingness to proceed with the contra ct. A is not bound to inform B . \\n18. “Misrepresentation ” defined .—“Misrepresentation ” means and includes — \\n(1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, \\nof that which is not true, t hough he believes it to be true;  \\n(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person \\ncommitting it,  or any one claiming under him; by misleading another to his pr ejudice , or to the \\nprejudice  of any one claiming under him;  \\n(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement , to make a mistake as to the substance \\nof the thing which i s the subject of the agreement.  \\n19. Voidability of a greements without free consent .—When consent to an agreement is caused by \\ncoercion,1*** fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party \\nwhose consent was so caused.  \\nA party to a contract whose cons ent was caused by fraud or mis represen tation, may, if he thinks fit, \\ninsist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have \\nbeen if the representations made had  been true.  \\nException .—If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the \\nmeaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so \\ncaused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence . \\nExplanation .—A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party \\non whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a \\ncontract voidable.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, intending to dece ive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s factory, and \\nthereby induces B to buy the factory. The contract is voidable at the option of B.  \\n(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that, five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s \\nfactory. B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After thi s \\nB buys the factory. The contract is not voidable on account of A ’s misrepresent ation.  \\n(c) A fraudulently informs B that A ’s estate is free from in  cumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a \\nmortgage. B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage d ebt redeemed.  \\n(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore \\nfrom A. Through A ’s ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under -value. The contract is voidable at the opt ion of A.  \\n(e) A is en titled to succeed  to an estate at the death of B ; B dies: C, having received intelligence of B ’s death, preven ts the \\nintelligence reaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate. The sale is voidable at the optio n of A.  \\n2[19A. Power to set aside contra ct induced by undue influence .—When consent to an agreement is \\ncaused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the par ty whose consent \\nwas so caused.  \\n                                                           \\n1.

Ins. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 3.  16 \\n Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has \\nreceived any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions  as to the Court may seem just.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A’s son has forged B ’s name to a promissory note. B under threat of prosecuting A ’s son, obtains a bond from A for the \\namount of the forged note. If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside.  \\n(b) A, a money -lender, advances Rs. 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for  \\nRs. 200 with interest at 6 per cent. per month. Th e Court may set the bond aside,  ordering B to repay the Rs. 100 with s uch \\ninterest as may seem just.]  \\n20.Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to  matter of fact .—Where both the',\n",

Ins. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 3.  16 \\n Any such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has \\nreceived any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions  as to the Court may seem just.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A’s son has forged B ’s name to a promissory note. B under threat of prosecuting A ’s son, obtains a bond from A for the \\namount of the forged note. If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside.  \\n(b) A, a money -lender, advances Rs. 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for  \\nRs. 200 with interest at 6 per cent. per month. Th e Court may set the bond aside,  ordering B to repay the Rs. 100 with s uch \\ninterest as may seem just.]  \\n20.Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to  matter of fact .—Where both the \\nparties to an agreement a re under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the ag reement, the agreement \\nis void.  \\nExplanation .—An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject -matter of \\nthe agreement , is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact. \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England to Bombay. It turns out that, \\nbefore the day of the bargain, the ship conveying the cargo had been cast away and the goods lost. Neither party wa s aware of th e \\nthese  facts. The agreement is void.  \\n(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the ho rse was dead at the time of  the bargain, though neither \\nparty was aware of the fact. The a greement is void.  \\n(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C. B was dead at the time of the agreement, but both  \\nparties were ignorant of the fact. The agreement is void.  \\n21. Effect of mist akes as to law .—A contract is not voidable because it  was caused by a mist ake as \\nto any law in force in 1[India]; but a mistak e as to a law not in force in 1[India] has the sa me effect as a \\nmistake of fact.  \\n2*   *   *   *   * \\nIllustration  \\nA and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian Law of Limitation : \\nthe contract is not voidable.  \\n3*   *   *   *   * \\n22. Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter  of fact .—A contract is not voidable \\nmerely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact.  \\n23. What considerations and o bjects are lawful , and what not .—The consideration or object of an \\nagreement is lawful, unless — \\nit is forbidden  by law4; or \\nis of such a nature that if permitted, it would defea t the provisions of any law; or  \\nis fraudulent ; or  \\ninvolves or implies injury to the p erson or property of another; or  \\nthe Court regards it as immora l, or opposed to public policy.  \\n                                                           \\n1. The original words ‘British India” have successively been amended by the A.O. 1948 and the A.O. 1950 to read as above.  \\n2. Para graph 2, ins. by the A.O. 1937, and as amended by the A.

See ss. 26, 27, 28 and 30, infra . 17 \\n In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every \\nagreement of which the object or con sideration is unlawful is void.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A agrees to sell his house to B for 10,000 rupees. Here B ’s prom ise to pay the sum of 10,000 rupees is the consideration \\nfor A ’s promise to sell the house, and A ’s promise to sell the house is the consideration for B ’s promise to pay the 10,000 rupees. \\nThese are lawful considerations.  \\n(b) A promises to pay B 1,000 rupe es at the end of six months, if C, who owes that sum to B, fails to pay it. B promises to \\ngrant time to C accordingly. Here, the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party , and they are \\nlawful considerations.  \\n(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if it is wrecked on a certain \\nvoyage. Here , A’s promise is the consideration for B ’s payment and B ’s payment is the consideration for A ’s promise and t hese \\nare lawful con siderations.  \\n(d) A promises to maintain B ’s child , and B promises to pay A 1,000 rupees yearly for the purpose. Here , the promise of \\neach party is the consideration for the promise of the other party. They are lawful considerations.  \\n(e) A, B and C enter in to an agreement for the division am ong them of gains acquired or to be acquired, by them by fraud. \\nThe agreement is v oid, as its object is unlawful.  \\n(f) A promises to obtain for B an em ployment in the public service and B promises to pay 1,000 rupees to A.  The agreement \\nis void, as the co nsideration for it is unlawful.  \\n(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease \\nof land belonging to his principal. The agreement between A and B  is void , as it implies a fraud by conce alment, by A, on his \\nprincipal.  \\n(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery, and B promises to restore the value of \\nthe things taken. The agreement is v oid, as its object is u nlawful.  \\n(i) A’s estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legislature, by which the defaulter  is \\nprohibited from purchasing the estate. B, upon an understanding with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate \\nto A upon receiving from him the price which B has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the transaction, in effect , a \\npurchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the law.  \\n(j) A, who is B ’s mukhtar, promises to exercise his in fluence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay 1,000 \\nrupees to A. The agreement is voi d, because it is immoral.  \\n(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting  \\nmay not be punishable under the Indian Penal Code  (45 of 1860) .  \\nVoid agreements  \\n24.Agreement s void, if consideration s and objects unlawful in part .—If any part of a single \\nconsideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several  considerations for a \\nsingle object, is u nlawful, the agreement is void.  \\nIllustration  \\nA promises to superintend, on behalf of B, a legal manufacture of indigo, and an illegal traffic in other articles. B promises \\nto pay to A a salary of 10,000 rupees a yea r. The agreement is void, the object of A ’s promise, and the consideration for B ’s \\npromise, being in part unlawful.  \\n25. Agreement without consideration, void, unless i t is in writing and registered ,or is a promise \\nto compensate for something done or is a promise to pay a debt barred by li mitation law .—An \\nagreement made without consideration is void, unles s— \\n(1) it is expressed in writing and registered under the law for the time being in force for the \\nregistration of 1[documents], and is made on account of  natural love and affection  between parties \\nstanding in a near rel ation to each other ; or unless  \\n(2) it is a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done \\nsomething for the promisor, or something which the promiso r wa s legally compellable to do; or \\nunless ; \\n                                                           \\n1.

This is a void agreement.  \\n(b) A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son, B, Rs. 1,000. A puts his promise to B into writing and  registers it.

Obli gation of parties to contracts .—The parties to a contract must either perform, or offer to \\nperform, their respective promises, unless such performance  is dispensed with or excused under the \\nprovisions of  this Act, or of any other law.  \\nPromises bind the representatives of the promisors in  case of the death of such promisors before \\nperfor mance, unless a contrary inten tion appears from the contract.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A promises to deliver goods to B on a certain day on payment of Rs. 1,000.

A ’s representatives \\nare bound to deliver the goods to B, and B is bound to pay the Rs. 1,000 to A ’s representatives.  \\n(b) A promises to paint a picture for B by a certain day, at a certain price. A dies before the day. The contract cannot be \\nenforced either by A ’s representatives or by B.  \\n38. Effect of refusal to accept offer of performance .—Where a promisor has made an offer of \\nperformance to the promisee, and the offer has not been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for  \\nnon-performance, nor does he thereby lose  his rights under the contract.  \\nEvery such offer must fu lfil the following conditions: — \\n(1) it must be unconditional;  \\n(2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circumstances that the person to \\nwhom it is made may have a reasonable oppo rtunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is \\nable and willing there and then to do the whole of what h e is bound by his promise to do;  \\n(3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee must have a \\nreasonable op portunity of seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is b ound by his \\npromise to deliver.  \\nAn offer to one of several joint promisees has the same legal conseque nces as an offer to all of them.  \\n  22 \\n Illustration  \\nA contracts to deliver to B  at his warehouse, on the 1st March, 1873, 100 bales of cotton of a particular quality. In order to \\nmake an offer of a performance with the effect stated in this section, A must bring the cotton to B ’s warehouse, on the appointed \\nday, under such circumstan ces that B may have areasonable opportunity of satisfying himself that the thing offered is cotton of \\nthe quality contracted for , and that there are 100 bales.  \\n39. Effect of refusal of party to p erform promise wholly .—When a party to a contract has refused  \\nto perform, or disabled himself from performing, his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end \\nto the contract, unless he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its c ontinuance.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre two nights in every week during \\nthe next two months, and B engages to pay her 100 rupees for each night ’s performance. On the sixth night A wilfully absents \\nherself from the theatre. B is at  liberty to put an end to the contract.  \\n(b) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at h is theatre two night ’s in every week during \\nthe next two months, and B engages to pay her at the rate of 100 rupees for  each night. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents \\nherself. With the assent of B, A sings on the seventh night. B has signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contr act, \\nand cannot now put an end to it, but is entitled to compensation for the d amage sustained by him through A ’s failure to sing on \\nthe sixth night.  \\nBy w hom contracts must be performed  \\n40.Person by w hom promise is to be performed .—If it appears from the nature of the case that it \\nwas the intention of the parties to any contract that any promise contained in it should be performed by \\nthe promisor himself, such promise must be performed by the promisor. In other cases, the promisor or  \\nhis representatives may employ a competent person to perform it.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money. A may perform this promise, either by personally paying the money to B or by \\ncausing it to be paid to B by another ; and, if A dies before the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the \\npromise, or empl oy some proper person to do so.  \\n(b) A promises to paint a picture for B. A must p erform this promise personally.  \\n41. Effect of accepting  performance from third pers on.—When a promisee accepts performance \\nof the promise from a third person, he cannot afterwards e nforce it against the promisor.  \\n42. Devolution of joint liabilities .—When two or more persons have made a joint promise, then, \\nunless a contrary intention appears by the contract, all such persons, during their joint lives, and, after the \\ndeath of any of them, his representative jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the \\nlast survivor, the representatives of all jo intly, must fulfil the promise.  \\n43.Any one of joint promiso rs may be compelled to perform .—When two or more persons make a \\njoint promise, the promisee may, in the absence of express agreemen t to the contrary, compel any 1[one o r \\nmore] of such joint promisors to pe rform the whole of the promise.  \\nEach pr omisor may compel contribution .—Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every \\nother joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a \\ncontrary inten tion appears from the contra ct. \\nSharing of l oss by default in contribution .—If any one of two or more joint promisors makes \\ndefault in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such def ault in \\nequal shares.  \\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 12 of 1891, s. 2 and the Second Schedule, Pt. I, for “one”.  23 \\n Explanation .—Nothing in this section shall prevent a surety from recovering from his principal, \\npayments made by the surety on behalf of the principal, or entitle the principal to recover anything from \\nthe surety on account of payment s made by the principal.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D 3,000 rupees. D may compel either A or B or C to pay him 3,000 rupees.  \\n(b) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D the sum of 3,000 rupees. C is compelled to pay the whole.

C is entitled to receive 500 rupees from A ’s estate, and 1,250 rupees from B.  \\n(c) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 rupees. C is unable to pay anything, and A is compelled to pay the \\nwhole. A is entitled to rece ive 1,500 rupees from B.  \\n(d) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 rupees, A and B being only sureties for C. C fails to pay. A and B \\nare compelled to pay the whole sum. They are entitled to recover it from C.  \\n44.Effect of  release of one join t promisor .—Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, \\na release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other join t promisor or \\njoint promisors ; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other jo int \\npromisor or joint promisors.1 \\n45. Devolution of joint rights .—When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, \\nthen, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim performance res ts, as \\nbetween him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the \\nrepresent ative of such deceased person j ointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the \\nlast survivor, with the representative s of all jointly.2 \\nIllustration',\n",

They are entitled to recover it from C.  \\n44.Effect of  release of one join t promisor .—Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, \\na release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other join t promisor or \\njoint promisors ; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other jo int \\npromisor or joint promisors.1 \\n45. Devolution of joint rights .—When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, \\nthen, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim performance res ts, as \\nbetween him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the \\nrepresent ative of such deceased person j ointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the \\nlast survivor, with the representative s of all jointly.2 \\nIllustration  \\nA, in consideration of 5,000 rupees, lent to him by B and C, promises B and C jointly to repay them that sum with interest \\non a day specified. B dies. The right to claim performance rests with B ’s representative jointly with  C during C ’s life, and after \\nthe death of C with the repr esentatives of B and C jointly.  \\nTime and place for performance  \\n46. Time for performance of promise, when no application is to be made and no time is \\nspecified .—Where, by the contract, a promisor is to perform his promise without application by the \\npromisee, and no time for performance is specified, the engagement must be perf ormed within a \\nreasonable time.  \\nExplanation .—The question “what is a reasonable time” is, in each parti cular case, a question of fact.  \\n47.Time and place for performance of promise, where time is specified  and no application to be \\nmade .—When a promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has undertaken to perform \\nit without application by the promisee, the promiso r may perform it at any time during the usual hours of \\nbusiness on such day and at the place at which the promise o ught to be performed.  \\nIllustration  \\nA promises to deliver goods at B ’s warehouse on the first January. On that day A brings the goods to B ’s warehouse, but \\nafter the usual hour for closing it, and they are not received. A has not performed his promise.  \\n48. Application for performance on certain day to be at proper time and place .—When a \\npromise is to be performed on a certain day, and the pr omisor has not undertaken to perform it without \\napplication by the p romisee, it is the duty of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and \\nwithin the usual hours of business.  \\n                                                           \\n1. See s. 138, infra . \\n2. For an Exception  to s. 45 in case of Government securities, see the Publ ic Debt Act, 1944 (18 of 1944), s. 8. 24 \\n Explanation .—The question “what is a proper time and place ” is, in each particular case, a question \\nof fact.  \\n49. Place for performance of promise, where no application to be made and no place fixed for \\nperformance .—When a promise is to be performed without application by the promisee, and no place is \\nfixed for the performance of it, it is the duty of the promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint a \\nreasonable place for the performance of the promise, a nd to perform it at such place.  \\nIllustration  \\nA undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day . A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for \\nthe purpose of receiving it, and must d eliver it to him at such place.  \\n50. Performance in manner or at time prescr ibed or sanctioned by promisee .—The performance \\nof any promise may be made in any manner , or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) B owes A 2,000 rupees. A desires B to pay the amount to A ’s account with C, a banker. B, who also banks with C, \\norders the amount to be transferred from his account to A ’s credit, and this is done by C. Afterwards, and before A knows of the \\ntransfer, C fails. There has been a good payment by B . \\n(b) A and B are mutually indebted. A and B settle an account by setting off one item against another, and B pays A the \\nbalance found  to be due from him upon such settlement. This amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which \\nthey ow ed to each other.  \\n(c) A owes B 2,000 rupees. B accepts some of A ’s goods in reduction of the debt. The delivery of go ods operates as a pa rt \\npayment.  \\n(d) A desires B, who owes him Rs. 100, to send him a note for Rs. 100 by post. The debt is discharged as soon as B puts into \\nthe post a letter containin g the note duly addressed to A.  \\nPerformance of reciprocal promises  \\n51.Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promise e ready and willing to  \\nperform .—When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor \\nneed perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promi se. \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B t o be paid for by B on delivery.  \\nA need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to  pay for the goods on delivery.  \\nB need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment . \\n(b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by instalments, the first ins talment to be paid on \\ndelivery.  \\nA need not deliver, unless B is ready and willing to pay the first instalment on del ivery.  \\nB need not pay the first instalment, unless A is ready and willing to deliver the goods on p ayment of the first instalment . \\n52.Order of perf ormance of reciprocal promises .—Where the order in which reciprocal promises \\nare to be performed is expressl y fixed by the contract, they shall b e performed in that order; and where the \\norder is not expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the natu re of the \\ntransaction requires.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A and B contract that A shall build a house for B at a fixed price. A ’s promise to build the house m ust be performed \\nbefore B ’s promise  to pay for it.  \\n(b) A and B contract that A shall make over his stock -in-trade to B at a fixed price,  and B promises to give security for the \\npayment of the money. A ’s promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires \\nthat A should have security b efore he delivers up his stock.  25 \\n 53. Liability of party preventing event on which the contract is to take effect .—When a contract \\ncontains reciprocal promises, and one party to the contract prevents the other from performing his \\npromise, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is e ntitled to \\ncompensation 1from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in consequence of the n on-\\nperformance of the contract.  \\nIllustration  \\nA and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a thousand rupees. B is ready and willing to execute the work \\naccordingly, but A preven ts him from doing so. The contract  is voidable at the option of B ; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is \\nentitled to recover from A compensation for any loss which he has i ncurred by its non -performance.  \\n54. Effect of default as to that promise which should be first performed, in contract con sisting \\nof reciprocal promises .—When a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot \\nbe performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the other has been performed, and the \\npromi sor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of \\nthe reciprocal promise, and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which \\nsuch other party may sustain by the n on-performanc e of the contract.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A hires B ’s ship to take in and convey, from Calcutta to the Mauritius, a cargo to be provided by A, B receiving a certain \\nfreight for its conveyance. A does not provide any cargo for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B ’s promise, and must \\nmake compensation to B for the loss which B sustains by the n on-performance of the contract.  \\n(b) A contracts with B to execute certain builder ’s work for a fixed price, B supplying the scaffolding and timber necessary \\nfor the work. B refuses to furnish any scaffolding or timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, an d \\nB is bound to make compensation to A for any loss caused to him by the n on-performance of the contract.  \\n(c) A contracts with B to  deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a ship which cannot arrive for a \\nmonth, and B engages to pay for the merchandise within a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. \\nA’s promise to deliver need no t be performed , and B must make compensation.  \\n(d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day, and B promises A to pay for them \\nwithin a month. A does not deliver according to his promise. B ’s promise to pay need not  be performed , and A must make \\ncompensation.  \\n55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contr act in which time is essential .—When a \\nparty to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or \\nbefore specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so \\nmuch of it as has not been performe d, becomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if the intention of \\nthe parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract.  \\nEffect of such fail ure when time is not essential .—If it was not the intention of the parties that time \\nshould be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such',\n",

B ’s ship does not go to Bombay, but A has opportunities of procuring \\nsuitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship. A avails himself of  \\nthose opportunities, but is put to trou ble and expense in doing so. A is entitled to receive compensation from B in respe ct of such \\ntrouble and expense.  \\n(c)A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of rice, no time being fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that  \\nhe will not ac cept the rice if tendered to him.

A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the \\nexcess, if any, of the contract price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the  time of the breach of promise.  \\n(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of jute to Mirzapur, for sale at that place, starting on a specified \\nday.

A repairs the house, but not \\naccording to contract. B is entitled to recover from A the cost of making the r epairs conform to the contract.  \\n(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from the first of January, for a certain price.

He must pay to B, by way o f \\ncompensation, a sum equal to the difference between the contract price and the price for which B could hire a similar ship for a \\nyear on  and from the first of January.  \\n(h) A contracts to supply B with a certain quantity of iron at a fixed price, being a higher price than that for which A could \\nprocure and deliver the iron. B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron. B must pay to A, by way of compensation, the differen ce \\nbetween the contract price of the iron and the sum for which A could have obtained and delivered it.  \\n(i) A delivers to B, a common carrier, a machine, to be conveyed, without delay, to A ’s mill   informing B that his mill is \\nstopped for want of the machine. B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A, in consequence, loses a profitable \\ncontract with the Government. A is entitled to receive from B, by way of compensation, the average amount of profit which \\nwould have b een made by the working of the mill during the time that delivery of it was delayed, but not the loss sustained \\nthrough the l oss of the Government contract.  \\n(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1,000 tons of iron at 100 rupees a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, \\ncontracts with C for the pur chase of 1,000 tons of iron at 80 rupees a ton, telling C that he does so for the purpose of performing \\nhis contract with B. C fails to perform his contract with A, who cannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the \\ncontract. C must pay to A 20,000 rupees, being the profit which A would have made by the perf ormance of his contract with B.  \\n(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a specified price, a certain piece of machinery. A does \\nnot deliver the piece of machinery at the time specified, and in consequence of this, B is obliged to procure another at a high er \\nprice than that which he was to have paid to A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made with a third \\nperson  at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been then communicated to A), and is compelled to make \\ncompensation for breach of that contract. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the differ ence between the contract price of \\nthe p iece of machi nery and the sum paid by B for another, but not the sum paid by B to the third  person by way of compensation.  \\n(l)A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the first of January, in order that B may give possession of it at th at \\ntime to C, to wh om B has contracted to let it. A is informed of the contract between B and C. A builds the house so badly that, \\nbefore the first of January, it falls down and has to be re -built by B, who, in consequence, loses the rent which he was to have \\nreceived from C , and is obliged to make compensation to C for the breach of his contract. A must make compensation to B for \\nthe cost of rebuilding the house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C.  \\n(m)A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular quality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it \\nto C with a similar warranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes liable to pay C a sum of \\nmoney by way of compensation. B is entitled to be reimbursed this sum by A.  31 \\n (n)A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does  not pay the money on that day , B, in consequence of \\nnot receiving the money on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined.

B afterwards, before the first \\nof January, contracts to sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market price of the first of January. A breaks hi s promise.  \\nIn estimating the compensation payable by A to B, the market price of the first of January, and not the profit which would \\nhave arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken into account.  \\n(p)A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on a fixed day. A knows nothing of B ’s mode of conducting his \\nbusiness. A breaks his promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not responsible to B for the loss caused \\nto B by the closing of the mill.  \\n(q)A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the first of January, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture in to caps of a \\nparticular kind, for which there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after the appointed tim e, and \\ntoo late to be used that year in making caps. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the diff erence between the \\ncontract price of the cloth and its market price at the time of delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain by making \\ncaps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in making p reparation for the manufacture.  \\n(r)A, a ship -owner, c ontracts with B to convey him from Calcutta to Sydney in A ’s ship, sailing on the first of January, and \\nB pays to A, by way of deposit, one -half of his passage -money. The ship does not sail on the first of January, and B, after being \\nin consequence detained in Calcutta for some time and thereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, \\nin consequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money. A is l iable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the \\nexpense to which  he is put by his detention in Calcutta, and the excess, if any, of the passage -money paid for the second ship over \\nthat agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money which B lost by arriving in Sydney too late.  \\n74.

T his is a contract of indemnity.  \\n125.Rights of indemnity -holder wh en sued .—The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting \\nwithin the scope  of his authority, is entitle d to recover from the promisor — \\n(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which \\nthe promise to indemnify ap plies;  \\n(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if , in bringing or defending it, he \\ndid not contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as it would have been prudent for him to act \\nin the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend the \\nsuit; \\n(3) all sums  which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such sui t, if the \\ncompromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been \\nprudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity,  or if the promisor \\nauthori zed him to compromise the suit.  \\n126. “Contract of guarantee ”, “surety ”, “principal debtor ” and “creditor ”.—A “contract of \\nguarantee” is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his \\ndefault. The person who gives the guarantee is called the “surety ”; the person in respect of whose default \\nthe guarantee is given is called the “principal de btor”, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is \\ncalled the “creditor ”. A guarantee  may be either oral or written.  \\n127. Consideration for guarantee .—Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the \\nprincipal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the s urety for giving the guarantee.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the \\nprice of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in cons ideration of A ’s promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient \\nconsideration for C ’s promise.  \\n(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if  \\nhe does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for \\nC’s promise.  \\n(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in defau lt of B. The \\nagreement is void.  35 \\n 128.

       " 'principal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the s urety for giving the guarantee.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the \\nprice of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in cons ideration of A ’s promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient \\nconsideration for C ’s promise.  \\n(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if  \\nhe does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for \\nC’s promise.  \\n(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in defau lt of B. The \\nagreement is void.  35 \\n 128. Surety ’s liability .—The liability of the surety is co - extensive with that of the principal debtor, \\nunless it is otherwise provided by t he contract.  \\nIllustration  \\nA guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable , not only \\nfor the amount of the bill , but also for any interest and charges w hich may have become due on it.  \\n129. “Continuing guarantee ”.—A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions , is called a \\n“continuing guarantee ”. \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B ’s zamindari, promises B to be responsible, to the \\namount of 5,000 rupees, for the due collection and payment by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee.  \\n(b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea -dealer, to the amount of £100, for any tea he may from time to time supply to C. B \\nsupplies C with tea to above the value of  £100, and C pays B for it. Afterwards , B supplies C with tea to the value of  £200. C \\nfails to pa y. The guarantee given by A was a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the exten t of £100. \\n(c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C and to be paid for in a month. B \\ndelivers five sack s to C. C pays for them. Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does riot pay for. The guarantee given \\nby A was not a continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable f or the price of the four sacks.  \\n130.Revo cation of continuing guarantee .—A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by \\nthe surety,  as to future transacti ons, by notice to the creditor.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A, in consideration of B ’s discounting, at A ’s request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the \\ndue payment of all such bills to the extent of 5,000 rupees. B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 rupees. Afterward s, at the \\nend of three months, A revokes the guarantee. This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent dis count. \\nBut A is liable to B for the 2,000 rupees, on d efault of C.  \\n(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him. B draws upon \\nC. C accepts the bill. A gives notice of revocation. C dishono urs the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarant ee. \\n131.Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety ’s death .—The death of the surety operates, in \\nthe absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regar ds \\nfuture transactions.  \\n132. Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected by arrangement between them that \\none shall be surety on other ’s default .—Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a \\ncertain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable only on the default of \\nthe other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to \\nthe third person under the first contract is not affected by the e xistence of the second contract, although \\nsuch third person may ha ve been aware of its existence.  \\nIllustration  \\nA and B make a joint and several promissory note to C. A makes it, in fact, as surety for B, and C knows this at the time \\nwhen the note is made. The fact that A, to the knowledge of C, made the note as surety for B, is no answer to a suit by C against \\nA upon the note . \\n133.Discharge of surety by  variance in terms of contract .—Any variance, made without the \\nsurety ’s consent, in the terms of the contract between the principal 1[debtor] and the creditor, discharges \\nthe surety as to transacti ons subsequent to the variance.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A becomes surety to C for B ’s conduct as a manager in C ’s bank. Afterwards, B and C contract, without A ’s consent, \\nthat B ’s salary shall be raised, and that he shall become liable for one -fourth of the losses on overdrafts. B allows a customer to \\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 24 of 1917, s. 2 and  the first  Schedule . 36 \\n overdraw, and the bank loses a sum of money. A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance made without his c onsent, and \\nis not  liable to make good this loss.  \\n(b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C, and of which the duties are \\ndefined by an Act of the Legislature. By a subsequent Act, the nature of the office is m aterially altered. Afterwards, B \\nmisconducts himself. A is discharged by the change from future liability under his guarantee, though the misco nduct of B is in \\nrespect  of a duty  not affected by the later Act.  \\n(c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A ’s becoming surety to C for B ’s duly accounting \\nfor moneys received by him as such clerk. Afterwards, without A ’s knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid \\nby a commission on the goods sold by him and not by a fixed salary. A is not liable for subsequent misconduct of B.  \\n(d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3,000 rupees for any oil supplied by C to B on credit. Afterwards B \\nbecomes embarrassed, and, without the knowledge of A, B and C contr act that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready \\nmoney, and that the paymen ts shall be applied to the then, existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on his guarantee for \\nany goods suppli ed after : this new arrangement.  \\n(e) C contracts to lend  B 5,000 rupees on the 1st March. A guarantees repayment. C pays the 5,000 rupees to B on the 1st \\nJanuary. A is discharged from his liability, as the contract has been varied, inasmuch as C might sue B for the  money before the \\n1st of March.  \\n134.Discharge o f surety by release or  discharge of principal debtor .—The surety is discharged by \\nany contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released , or by \\nany act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the dis charge of the principal \\ndebtor.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A gives a guarantee to C for goods to be supplied by C to B. C supplies goods to B, and afterwards B becomes \\nembarrassed and contracts with his creditors (including C) to assign to them his property in consideration of their releasing him \\nfrom their demands. Here B is released from his debt by the contract with C, and A is discharged from his suretyship.  \\n(b) A contracts w ith B to grow a crop of indigo o n A’s land and to deliver it to B at a fixed rate, and C guarantees A ’s \\nperformance of this contract. B diverts a stream of water which is necessary for  the irrigation of A ’s land and thereby prevents \\nhim from raising the indigo. C is no longer liable on his guarantee.  \\n(c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B supplying the necessary timber. C \\nguarantees A ’s performance of the  contract. B omits to supply the timber. C is discharged from his suretyship . \\n135. Discharge of surety when creditor compounds with, gives time to, or agree s not to sue, \\nprincipal debtor .—A contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes \\na composition with, or promises to give time to, or not to sue, the principal debtor, discharges the surety, \\nunless the s urety assents to such contract.  \\n136. Surety not discharged when agreement made with third person to give time to pri ncipal \\ndebtor .—Where a contract to give time to the principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third \\nperson, and not with the principal debtor , the surety is not discharged.  \\nIllustration  \\nC, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as suret y for B, and accepted by B, contracts with M to give time to \\nB. A is not discharged.  \\n137. Creditor ’s forbearance to sue does not discharge surety .—Mere forbearance on the part of \\nthe creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any other remedy against him does not, in the absence \\nof any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety.  \\nIllustration  \\nB owes to C a debt guaranteed  by A. The debt becomes payable. C does not sue B for a year after the debt has become \\npayable. A is not discharged from his suretyship.  37 \\n 138.Release of one co -surety does not discharge others .—Where there are co -sureties, a release by \\nthe creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released from \\nhis respons ibility to the other sureties1. \\n139. Discharge of surety by creditor ’s act or omission impairing surety ’s eventual remedy .—If \\nthe creditor does any act which  is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which \\nhis duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the \\nprincipal debtor is thereby impa ired, the surety is discharged.  \\nIllustrations',\n",

A is not discharged from his suretyship.  37 \\n 138.Release of one co -surety does not discharge others .—Where there are co -sureties, a release by \\nthe creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released from \\nhis respons ibility to the other sureties1. \\n139. Discharge of surety by creditor ’s act or omission impairing surety ’s eventual remedy .—If \\nthe creditor does any act which  is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which \\nhis duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the \\nprincipal debtor is thereby impa ired, the surety is discharged.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work reaches certain stages. A becomes \\nsurety to C for B ’s due performance of the contract. C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments. A is  \\ndischarged by this prepayment.  \\n(b) C lends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note made in C ’s favour by B, and by A as surety \\nfor B, together with a bill of sale of B ’s furniture, which gives power to C to sell the furniture, and apply the proceeds in \\ndischarge of the note. Subsequently, C sells the furniture, but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a small price \\nis realized. A is dischar ged from liability on the note.  \\n(c) A puts M as apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M ’s fidelity. B promises on his part that he will, at least once \\na month, see M make up the cash. B omits to see this done as promised, and M embezzles. A is no t liable to B on his guarantee.  \\n140.Rights of su rety on payment or performance .—Where a guaranteed debt has become due, or \\ndefault of the principal debtor to perform a guaranteed du ty has taken place, the surety upon payment or \\nperformance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor ha d against the \\nprincipal debtor.  \\n141.Surety ’s right to benefit of creditor ’s securities .—A surety is entitled to the benefit of every \\nsecurity which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship is \\nentered into, w hether the surety knows of the ex istence of such security or not ; and if the creditor loses, \\nor, without the consent of the surety, parts with such security, the surety is discharged to the exten t of the \\nvalue of the security.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a)C, advances to B, his tenant, 2,000 rupees on the guarantee of A. C has also a further security for the 2,000 rupees by a \\nmortgage of B ’s furniture. C cancels the  mortgage. B becomes insolvent and C sues A on his guarantee. A is discharged from \\nliability to the amount  of the value of the furniture.  \\n(b)C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for that advance from A. C afterwards \\ntakes B ’s goods in execution under the decree, and then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution. A is discharged.  \\n(c)A, as surety for B, makes a bond jointly with B to C, to secure a loan from C to B. Afterwards, C obtains from B a further \\nsecurity for the same debt. Subsequently, C gives up the further  security. A is not discharged.  \\n142. Guarantee obtained b y misrepresentation invalid .—Any guarantee which has been obtained \\nby means of misrepresentation made by the creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning a \\nmaterial part of the transaction, is invalid.  \\n143.

B fails to account for some of his receipts, and A in consequence calls \\nupon him to furnish security for his duly accounting. C gives his guarantee for B ’s duly accounting. A does not acquaint C with \\nB’s previous conduct. B afterwards makes def ault. The guarantee is invalid.  \\n                                                           \\n1. See s. 44, supra . 38 \\n (b)A guarantees to C payment fo r iron to be supplied by him to B to the amount of 2,000 tons. B and C have privately \\nagreed that B should pay five rupees per ton beyond the market price, such excess to be applied in liquidation of an old debt . This \\nagreement is concealed from A. A is no t liable as a surety.  \\n144. Guarantee on contract that creditor shall not a ct on it until co -surety joins .—Where a \\nperson gives a guarantee upon a contract that the creditor shall not act upon it until another person has \\njoined in it as co -surety, the guarantee is not valid if t hat other person does not join.  \\n145.Implied promise to indemnify surety .—In every contract of guarantee there is an implied \\npromise by the principal debtor to indemnify the surety, and the surety is entitled to recover from the \\nprincipal debtor whatever sum he has rightfully paid under the guarantee, but, no sums which he has paid \\nwrongfully.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a)B is indebted to C, and A is surety for the debt. C demands payment from A, and on his refusal sues him for the amount. \\nA defends the suit, having reasonable grounds for doing so, but is compelled to pay the amount of the debt with costs. He can \\nrecover from B the amount paid by him for costs,  as well as the principal debt.  \\n(b)C lends B a sum of money, and A, at the request of B, accepts a bill of exchange drawn by B upon A to secure the \\namount.

The contract is voidable, as betwe en B and C, at the option of C.  \\n(b) A, the captain of B ’s ship, signs bills of lading without having received on board the goods mentioned therein. The bills \\nof lading are void as betwee n B and the pretended cosignor.  \\n \\n  52 \\n CHAPTER XI. —[OF PARTNERSHIP. ]Rep. by the Indian Partnership Act , 1932 (9 of 1932), s. 73 \\nand the Second Schedule.  \\n239.

Operation of  transfer. —Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily \\nimplied, a transfer of property passes forthwith  to the transferee all the interest which the \\ntransferor is then capable of passing in the property, and in the legal incidents thereof.  \\nSuch incidents include, where the property is land, the easements annexed thereto, the rents and \\nprofits there of accruing after the transfer, and all things attached to the earth;  \\nand, where the property is machinery attached to the earth, the moveable parts \\nthereof;  \\nand, where the property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent thereof \\naccruing after  the transfer, and the locks, keys, bars, doors, windows and all other things \\nprovided for permanent use therewith;  \\nand, where the property is a debt or other actionable claim, the securities therefor \\n(except where they are also for other debts or claims n ot transferred to the transferee), but \\nnot arrears of interest accrued  before the transfer;  \\nand, where the property is money or other property yielding income, the interest or income thereof \\naccruing after the transfer takes effect.  \\n9. Oral transfer. —A transfer of property may be made without writing in every case \\nin which a writing is not expressly required by law.  \\n10. Condition restraining alienation .—Where property is transferred subject to a \\ncondition or limitation absolutely restraining the transfer ee or any person claiming under him \\nfrom parting with or disposing of his interest in the property, the condition or limitation is \\nvoid, except in the case of a lease where the condition is for the benefit of the lessor or those \\nclaiming under him: provide d that property may be transferred to or for the benefit of a \\nwoman (not being a Hindu, Muhammadan or Buddhist), so that she shall not have power \\nduring her marriage to transfer or charge the same or her beneficial interest therein.  \\n11. Restriction repugna nt to interest created. —Where, on a transfer of property, an \\ninterest ther ein is created absolutely in favour of any person, but the terms of the transfer \\ndirect that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular manner, he shall be \\nentitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction.  \\n1[Where any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property \\nfor the purpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property,  \\nnothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to \\nenforce such direction or any remedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof.]  \\n12. Conditi on making interest determinable  on insolvency or attempted alie nation.—\\nWhere property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation making any interest therein, \\nreserved or given to or for the benefit of any person, to cease on his becoming insolvent or \\nendeavouring to transfer or dispose of the same, such cond ition or limitation is void.  \\nNothing in this section applies to a condition in a lease for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming \\nunder him.  \\n13. Transfer for benefit of unborn person. —Where,  on a transfer of property, an \\ninterest therein is created for the benefit of a person not in existence at the date of the \\ntransfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the interest created for the \\nbenefit of such person shall not take effect, unless it extends to the whole of the remaining \\ninterest of the transferor in the property.  \\n                                                      \\n1.

The interest so \\ncreated for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not extend to the whole of A's remaining inte rest in \\nthe property.  \\n14. Rule against perpetuity .—No transfer of p roperty can operate to create an interest which is to \\ntake effect after the lifetime of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the \\nminority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he \\nattains full age, the interest created is to belong.  \\n15. Transfer to class some of whom come under sections 13 and 14. —If, on a transfer of property, \\nan interest therein is created for the benefit of a class of persons with regard to some of whom such \\ninterest fails by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14; such  interest fails 1[in regard \\nto those persons only and not in regard to the whole class].  \\n2[16. Transfer to take effect on failure of prior interest. —Where, by reason of any of the \\nrules contained in sections 13 and 14, an interest created for the benefit of a person or of a class \\nof persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the \\nsame transaction and intended to take effect after or  upon failure of such prior interest also fails. \\n17. Direction for accumulation .—(1) Where the terms of a transfer of property direct that the \\nincome arising from the property shall be accumulated either wholly or in part during a period longer \\nthan—  \\n(a) the life of the transferor, or  \\n(b) a period of eighteen years from the date of the transfer,  \\nsuch direction shall, save as hereinafter provided, be void to the extent to which the period during \\nwhich the accumulation is directed exceeds the longer of the aforesaid periods, and at the end of \\nsuch last -mentioned period the property and the income thereof shall be disposed of as if the \\nperiod during which the accumulation has been directed to be made had elapsed.  \\n(2) This section shall not affect any directio n for accumulation for the purpose of — \\n(i) the payment of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the \\ntransfer, or  \\n(ii) the provision of portions for children or remoter issue of the transferor or of any other person \\ntakin g any interest under the transfer, or  \\n(iii) the preservation or maintenance of the property transferred;  \\nand such direction may be made accordingly.\",\n",

Transfer in perpetuity for benefit of public .—The restrictions in sections 14, 16 and                     \\n17 shall not apply in the case of a transfer of property for the benefit of the public in the \\nadvancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any other object beneficial to \\nmankind.]  \\n19. Vested interest .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour \\nof a person without specifying the time when it is to take effect, or in terms specifying that it is to \\ntake effect forthwith or on the happening of an event which must happen, su ch interest is vested, \\nunless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer.  \\nA vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession.  \\nExplanation. —An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely -from \\na provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same \\nproperty is given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is \\n                                                      \\n1. Subs. b y Act 20 of 1929, s. 9, for “as regards the whole class”.  \\n2. Subs. by s. 10, ibid., for s . 16, 17 and 18.  \\n 13 \\n directed to be accumulated until t he time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a \\nparticular event shall happen the interest shall pass to another person.  \\n20. When unborn person acquires vested interest on transfer for his benefit .—Where, on \\na transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then living, he \\nacquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appear from the terms of the transfer, a vested \\ninterest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his bi rth. \\n21. Contingent interest. —Where , on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in \\nfavour of a person to take effect only on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a \\nspecified uncertain event shall not happen, such person thereb y acquires a contingent interest in \\nthe property. Such interest becomes a vested interest, in the former case, on the happening of the \\nevent, in the latter, when the happening of the event becomes impossible.  \\nException. —Where, under a transfer of property,  a person becomes entitled to an interest \\ntherein upon attaining a particular age, and the transferor also gives to him absolutely the income \\nto arise from such interest before he reaches that age, or directs the income or so much thereof as \\nmay be necessa ry to be applied for his benefit, such interest is not contingent.  \\n22. Transfer to members of a class who attain a particular age. —Where, on a transfer  of \\nproperty, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a class as shall attain a \\nparticular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has not attained that age.  \\n23. Transfer contingent on happening of specified uncertain event. —Where, on a transfer  of \\nproperty, an interest therein is to accrue to a specified perso n if a specified uncertain event shall \\nhappen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest fails unless such \\nevent happens before, or at the same time as, the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist.  \\n24. Transfer to such of certain persons as survive at some period not specified .—Where , on \\na transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to such of certain persons as shall be surviving \\nat some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go  to such of them as shall be \\nalive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary intention appears \\nfrom the terms of the transfer.  \\nIllustration  \\nA transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or to the \\nsurvivor of them. C dies during the life of B. D survives B . At B's death the property passes to D.  \\n25. Conditional transfer. —An interest created on a transfer of property and dependent upon a \\ncondition fails if the fulfilment of the condition is impossible, or is forbidden by law, or is of such a \\nnature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent, or involves or \\nimplies injury to the person or property of another, or the Court rega rds it as immoral or opposed to \\npublic policy.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an hour. The lease is void.  \\n(b) A gives Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall marry A's daughter C. At the d ate of the transfer C was dead. The \\ntransfer is void.  \\n(c) A transfers Rs. 500 to B or condition that she shall murder C. The transfer is void.  \\n(d) A transfer s Rs. 500 to his n iece C if she will desert her husband. The transfer is void.  \\n26. Fulfilment of condition precedent. —Where the terms of a transfer of property impose a  \\ncondition to be fulfilled before a person can take an interest in the property, the condition shall be deemed \\nto have been fulfilled if it has been substantially complied with.  \\nIllustr ations  \\n(a) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D, and E. E dies. B marries with \\nthe consent of C and D. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition.  \\n(b) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall ma rry with the consent of C, D and E.  B marries without the \\nconsent of C, D and E, but obtains their consent after the marriage. B has not fulfilled the condition.  14 \\n 27. Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior \\ndisposition .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and \\nby the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the \\nprior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of \\nthe prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the \\ntransferor.  \\nBut, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect \\nonly in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not \\ntake effect unless the prior disposi tion fails in that manner.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A ’s death, and, \\nif he should neglect to do so, to C. B dies in A's life -time. The disposition in favour of C takes effect.  \\n(b) A transfers property to his wife; but, in case she should die in his life -time, transfers to B that which he had \\ntransferred to her. A and his wife perish together, under circumstances which make it impossible to prove that she died \\nbefor e him. The disposition in favour of B does not take effect.  \\n28. Ulterior transfer conditional on happening or not happening of specified event .—On a \\ntransfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the condition \\nsuperadd ed that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest shall pass to another person, \\nor that in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen such interest shall pass to another person. In \\neach case the dispositions are subject to the r ules contained in sections 10, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27.  \\n29. Fulfilment of condition subsequent .—An ulterior disposition of the kind contemplated by the \\nlast preceding section cannot take effect unless the condition is strictly fulfilled.  \\nIllustration  \\nA transfers Rs. 500 to B, to be paid to him on his attaining his majority or marrying, with a proviso that, if B dies a \\nminor or marries without C's consent, the Rs. 500 shall go to D. B marries when only 17 years of age, without C's consent. \\nThe transfer  to D takes effect.  \\n30. Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition .—If the ulterior disposition \\nis not valid, the prior disposition is  not affected by it.  \\nIllustration  \\nA transfers a farm to B for her life, and, if she do not deser t her husband to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as \\nif no condition had been inserted.  \\n31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens \\nor does not happen .—Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein \\nmay be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain \\nevent shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A trans fers a farm to B for his life, with  a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease \\nto have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life -interest in the farm.\",\n",
       " \"30. Prior disposition not affected by invalidity of ulterior disposition .—If the ulterior disposition \\nis not valid, the prior disposition is  not affected by it.  \\nIllustration  \\nA transfers a farm to B for her life, and, if she do not deser t her husband to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as \\nif no condition had been inserted.  \\n31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens \\nor does not happen .—Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein \\nmay be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain \\nevent shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A trans fers a farm to B for his life, with  a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease \\nto have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life -interest in the farm.  \\n(b) A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go  to England within three years after the date of the transfer, \\nhis interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases.  \\n32. Such condition must not be invalid .—In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to \\nexist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute \\nthe condition of the creation of an interest.  \\n33. Transfer conditional on performance of act, no time  being specifi ed for                          \\nperformance .—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that \\nthe person taking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the \\nconditi on is broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance \\nof the act.  \\n34. Transfer conditional on performance of act, time being specified .—Where an act is to be \\nperformed by a person either as a condition to be fulf illed before an interest created on a transfer of 15 \\n property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non -fulfillment of which the interest is to pass from \\nhim to another person, and a time is specified for the performance of the act, if such performance within \\nthe specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly benefited by non -fulfilment \\nof the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for performing the act as shall be \\nrequisite to make up for the delay caus ed by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of \\nthe act, then, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non -fulfilment of the condition \\nrendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as again st him be deemed to have been \\nfulfilled.  \\nElection  \\n35. Election when necessary .—Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right \\nto transfer, and as part of the same transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such \\nowner  must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall \\nrelinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his \\nrepresentative as if it had not been disposed of,  \\nsubject nevertheless,  \\nwhere the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become \\nincapable of making a fresh transfer,  \\nand in all cases where the transfer is for consideration,  \\nto the charge of making good to th e disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property \\nattempted to be transferred to him.  \\nIllustrations  \\nThe farm of Sultanpur is the property of C and worth Rs. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, givin g \\nby the same instr ument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000.  \\nIn the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B.  \\nThe rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe \\nthat which he professes to transfer to be his own.  \\nA person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need \\nnot elect.  \\nA person who in his one capacity takes a  benefit under the transaction may in another dissent \\ntherefrom.  \\nException to the last preceding four rules. —Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred \\non the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit i s expressed to be \\nin lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he \\nis not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction.  \\nAcceptance of the benefit by the person  on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to \\nconfirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence \\nthe judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the c ircumstances.  \\nSuch knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the \\nperson on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to \\nexpress dissent.  \\nSuch knowledge of waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place \\nthe persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had \\nnot been done.  \\nIllustration  \\nA transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal -mine. C takes possession \\nof the mine and exhausts it.

Transfer how effected. —For the purpose of making a gift of immoveable \\nproperty, the transfer must be ef fected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of \\nthe donor, and attested by at least two witnesses.  \\nFor the purpose of making a gift of moveable property, the transfer may be effected  \\neither by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery.  \\nSuch delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered.  \\n124. Gift of existing and future property. —A gi ft comprising both existing and future \\nproperty is void as to th e latter.  \\n125. Gift to several, of whom one does not accept .—A gift of a thing to two or more \\ndonees, of whom one does not accept it, is void as to the interest which he would have \\ntaken had he accepted.  \\n126. When gift may be suspended or revoked .—The dono r and done e may agree that \\non the happening of any specified event which does not depend on the will of the donor a \\ngift shall be suspended or revoked; but a gift which the parties agree shall be revocable \\nwholly or in part , at the mere w ill of the donor , is void wholly or in part, as the case may \\nbe. \\nA gift  may also be revoked in any of the cases (save want or failure of consideration) in \\nwhich, if it were a contract, it might be rescinded.  \\nSave as aforesaid, a gift cannot be revoked.  \\nNothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the rights of transferees for \\nconsideration without notice.  \\nIllustrations  \\n(a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B’s assent, the right to take back the field in case B \\nand his descendants dies before A . B dies without descendants in A’s lifetime. A may take back the field.  \\n(b) A gives a lakh of rupees to B, reserving to himself, with B’s assent, the right to take back at \\npleasure Rs. 10,000 out of the lakh. The gift holds good as to Rs. 90,000, but is vo id as to Rs.10,000, which \\ncontinue to belong to A.  \\n127. Onerous gifts. —Where a gift is in the form of a single transfer to the same person \\nof several things of which one is, and the others are not, burdened by an obligation, the \\ndonee can take nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully.  \\nWhere a gift is in the form of two or more separate and independent transfers to the \\nsame person of several things, the don ee is at liberty to accept one of them and refuse the \\nothers, although the former may be beneficial and the latter onerous.  \\nOnerous gift to disqualified person .—A don ee not competent to contract and \\naccepting property burdened by any obligation is not bound by his acceptance. But if, after \\nbecoming competent to contract and being  aware of the obligation, he retains the property \\ngiven, he becomes so bound.  \\n 44 \\n Illustrations  \\n(a) A has shares in X, a prosperous joint stock company, and also shares in Y, a joint stock company, in \\ndifficulties. Heavy calls are expected in respect of the s hares in Y. A give s B all his shares in joint stock \\ncompanies. B refuses to accept the shares in Y. He cannot take the shares in X.  \\n(b) A, having a lease for a term of  years of a house at a rent which he and his representatives are bound \\nto pay during the  term, and which is more than the house can be let for, given to B the lease, and also, as a \\nseparate and independent transaction, a sum of money. B refuses to accept the lease. He does not by his \\nrefusal forfeit the money.  \\n128. Universal donee. —Subject to  the provisions of section 127, where a gift consists \\nof the donor’s whole property, the done is personally liable for all the debts due by 1[and \\nliabilities of] the donor at the time of the gift to the extent of the property comprised \\ntherein.  \\n129. Saving of donations mortis causa  and Muhammadan law. —Nothing i n this \\nChapter related to gifts of moveable property made in contemplation of death, or shall be \\ndeemed to affect any rule of Muhammadan law  2***. \\n3[CHAPTER VIII \\nOF TRANSFERS OF ACTIONABLE   CLAIMS  \\n130.
